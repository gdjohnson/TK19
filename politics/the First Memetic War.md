The First Memetic War: it’s all about outcompeting. When a new niche forms: First you get weeds, then you get trees. [[Short-termism|Short-term]] vs. long-term is a tradeoff: Charlie XCX vs. Kid A. We are living in a new memetic landscape, lacking cultural memory or the necessary tools to recognize or believe in the sustainable solutions.

> [Initially], plants with a short life history that specialize in colonization emerge; these first-stage plants are often called weeds, or “weedy ephemerals,” and make up a large number of agricultural pest species. But these initial colonizers specialize in colonization at the expense of long-term competitiveness for light. Second, a wave of plants that are not as good at spreading their seed, but a little better at monopolizing light, gain dominance. These are followed by plants that are even better at long-term competition.

(This is part of why federal laws and constitutional principles take so long to change. Stewart Brand’s “levels of pace”: Municipal and state levels are much quicker, which is helpful in a laboratory of democracy.)

One conciliatory frame for both sides in this terrible issue: trauma has stunted a community; a lack of feeling live possibility (think the studies on growth mindset: you have to believe the game is winnable and worth playing). But what’s unclear is the efficacy of the responses in the latter half of the 20th C & early 21st: the possibility that suppression works better than obsession, that legitimizing and dwelling increases the psychic footprint of the adversary.

## Hermeneutics of suspicion, motivational speech, & "messaging culture"

**Callard 2020: Should we cancel Aristotle? (NYT)**

> There is a kind of speech that it would be a mistake to take literally, because its function is some kind of messaging. Advertising and political oratory are examples of messaging, as is much that falls under the rubric of “making a statement,” like boycotting, protesting or publicly apologizing. Such words exist to perform some extra-communicative task; in messaging speech, some aim other than truth-seeking is always at play.

> What makes speech truly free is the possibility of disagreement without enmity, and this is less a matter of what we can say, than how we can say it. “Cancel culture” is merely the logical extension of what we might call “messaging culture,” in which every speech act is classified as friend or foe, in which literal content can barely be communicated, and in which very little faith exists as to the rational faculties of those being spoken to. In such a context, even the cry for “free speech” invites a nonliteral interpretation, as being nothing but the most efficient way for its advocates to acquire or consolidate power.
