# The New Class

## Overview

The New Class, which began in the early 2010s to replace civil liberalism, was perhaps most defined by an attitude sometimes (derogatorily) termed “safetyism.” Support for its general platform doubled or tripled over the decade, with an emphasis on psychic health and the wellbeing of members over more traditional liberal rights such as speech or bodily integrity. Part of this shift included a reclassification of verbal or psychological aggression as violence proper. The ideology of its dominant strains was sometimes referred to as “race reductionism,” due to its emphasis on racialized explanations for individual and group outcomes over other competing explanations such as class and culture. While a “class-reductionist” movement, in the tradition of Marxist historiography, was also gaining traction among the young Left in this period—beginning with Occupy movement at the decade’s start, and peaking in 2020 with the second primary defeat of Senator Sanders, this outlook was rivalrous with, and would be outcompeted by, until the Second Memetic War of the late 2020s, the skillful organization of safetyist organizing.

Memetic warfare is part of the famous "way things are" now, alongside incumbent advantage, public hysteria, and collapsed bufferzones between communities. The way things are might change, but not right now and not for you. 

### 1969, Half a Century Later
Arendt’s words in her 1969 NYRB piece, “Reflections in Violence,” describe the conflict which brewed through the 2010s:

> Rage and violence turn irrational only when they are directed against substitutes… We all know, for example, that it has become rather fashionable among white liberals to react against “black rage” with the cry, We are all guilty, and black militants have proved only too happy to accept this “confession” and to base on it some of their more fantastic demands. In this particular instance, it is in addition a dangerous and obfuscating escalation of racism into some higher, less tangible regions: The real rift between black and white is not healed when it is being translated into an even less reconcilable conflict between collective innocence and collective guilt.

### Internet as Direct Democracy

Curtis Yarvin, June 2020:

> In 2020, the network would be the government. For the first time, direct democracy would scale.  In 2020, everyone would be their own representative in some planetary assembly. In 2020, we would have real democracy: routed over TCP/IP to everything on Planet Three with two legs that wasn't a bird.

We are living, Yarvin writes, in a "total state" where political engagement (i.e. "any volutary relationship with power," whether resisting or seizing it ). In this total state, "everyone and everything is infused" with this engagement with power, an affordance of the Internet.

### Social Justice

Social justice, despite the good intentions of many of its participants, and the validity of many of its critiques, fell far short of a noble or praise-worthy ideological movement, predictable as its disappointments may be. Just as it feigned outrage at the weaponization of shame, it weaponized shame in turn. It denied in speakers the distinction between intentionality and reception, and assumed all speakers operate within a shared system of signification. It denied the importance of context to the interpretation of utterance. It denied the relativism of individuals’ morality to the standards of their age (the application of cultural relativism across time & not merely space). It on one hand made a public argument for prejudice as structural and inescapable, and on the other, treated those demonstrating prejudice as sinners worthy of scorn. It treated humans as categories and generalizations, even as it protested categories and generalization. 

In other words, it excelled in motte-and-bailey: noble self-professions of value and less-than-noble tactics. Or perhaps we might say that its issue was a lack of consistency at higher orders of reasoning. It could not escape the paradigms of racial-nationalism which it sought to, because rather than flattening their dynamics, it inverted them. And so the pressures and unchosenness of acculturation was denied for individuals of the dominant society and blanket-imposed on the marginalized. In other words, the former group's subjectivity was conceptualized in the sense of agentic freedom; the latter group's in terms of subjected determination. It was the patronization of neocolonialism reiterated, with the trappings of empathic antiracism.

#### Antiracism as Religion

William McGloughlin, _Revivals, Awakenings, and Reform_:

> A religious revival or a great awakening begins when accumulated pressures for change produce such acute personal and social stress that the whole culture must break the crust of custom, crash through the blocks in the mazeways, and find new socially structured avenues along which the members of the society may pursue their course in mutual harmony with one another.

Led by the celebrity class (actors, singers, and the bad comedians) many white Americans began a cycling of mass repentance and guilt admission. At protests, this took the forum of call-and-response style chanting: "I have benefitted from my white privilege. I will work to combat racism and uphold equality." "I take responsibility," individual after individual addresses the camera in black and white iPhone shot (the selfie camera) as they read off a script.
