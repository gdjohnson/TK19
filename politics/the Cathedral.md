## Yarvin: Open Letter to an Open-Minded Progressive

Crispy's synopsis:

> 1. The post-1945 is run by the US. Everyone at least 70% agrees with this. But the machine that is the US is more abstract than the government, it's the institutions that disseminate and protect ideas. That's the Cathedral.
> 2. The Cathedral is liberalism. The left-leaning people are the inner-party and they inhabit all the major knowledge dissemination and validation routes, e.g. the univeristies and the press, which means that the left-leaning ideology get propagated.
> 3. Left-leaning ideology is not stationary, it goes farther and farther to the left. Consider attitudes on gay marriage, for instance, and how quickly those have changed.
> 4. Because of the space the cathedral occupies, it is self-propagating. This is not intentional, it's a matter of spontaneous coordination, because over time the things that protect the cathedral win due to selection. This would not happen in any situation, it happens because the Cathedral is _already_ in power. How did the Cathedral get into power? Weeee, that's a long one, but the argument boils down to: spontaneous coordination leads to powerful coordinating powers eventually having historical power, and the equalizing force tends to destroy the old order. But that's way too general—Moldbug isn't tied to it as an inevitably, at least in my reading, so much as very likely because of the historical circumstances.
> 5. Because information legitimacy comes from the Cathedral, it is very difficult to fight it. Of course, elements of the cathedral "fight" but those fights tend to reinforce and _raise_ the baseline agreement in the current forces. Think about the escalation around the discourse around racism now. Or the escalation around gay marriage in the last two decades.
> 6. Because the Cathedral controls the information landscape, it is self-legitimazing due to how we view history. For example, there tends to be a belief that the '60s civil rights movement failed in many of its ambitions. This is certainly true of its most intense ambitions, but ultimately the ability for a minority of the population to enact change in this case was huge! But people who create media, who are largely in line with our spontaneously emergent notion of the Cathedral, are attached to a narrative of being the underdog and that narrative is very effective at forming coalitions and propagating itself in the next generation.

## Jonathan Haidt: Two incompatible sacred values in American universities

The political composition of the professoriate, which as recently as the 90s was 2:1 left to right, has skyrocketed in recent years to 6:1, university-wide, and e.g. 17:1 in psychology departments. Views under such a homogenous regime become, in Mill's words, strongly held but weakly supported (in terms of having reasons or evidence for the strong holding).

The traditional telos of a university was truth; today, it has moved toward affecting change. 

### Contextual Discussion

[1:43 PM] suspended reason: "the cathedral is unabashedly real"
[1:43 PM] suspended reason: the cathedral makes no attempts to hide its existence, other than to deny it verbally
[1:44 PM] suspended reason: Moldbug was right!! I always hated that guy! and here we are!
[1:44 PM] crispy_chicken: Yeah...
[1:44 PM] crispy_chicken: Confession:
[1:44 PM] crispy_chicken: I've spent the last week reading "Open Letter to an Open-Minded Progressive"
[1:44 PM] crispy_chicken: and I pretty much agree
[1:44 PM] crispy_chicken: Not on some of the finer points
[1:45 PM] crispy_chicken: But in terms of cultural machine, does it really seem that ridiculous?
[1:45 PM] suspended reason: think ya could bullet-point some of the main gist?
[1:45 PM] crispy_chicken: with pleasure
[1:45 PM] suspended reason: understand yr busy, nw if so
[1:45 PM] suspended reason: oh great!
[1:45 PM] crispy_chicken: This is my break time
[1:45 PM] crispy_chicken: Between schmoozing
[1:46 PM] suspended reason: luff it
[1:46 PM] crispy_chicken: too much schmooze
[1:46 PM] suspended reason: schmooze or lose
[1:47 PM] crispy_chicken: 1. The post-1945 is run by the US. Everyone at least 70% agrees with this. But the machine that is the US is more abstract than the government, it's the institutions that disseminate and protect ideas. That's the Cathedral.
[1:48 PM] crispy_chicken: 2. The Cathedral is liberalism. The left-leaning people are the inner-party and they inhabit all the major knowledge dissemination and validation routes, e.g. the univeristies and the press, which means that the left-leaning ideology get propagated.
[1:50 PM] crispy_chicken: 3. Left-leaning ideology is not stationary, it goes farther and farther to the left. Consider attitudes on gay marriage, for instance, and how quickly those have changed.
[1:51 PM] snav: i hate the reification of "the cathedral" into an entity, because i think it gives the wrong impression
[1:52 PM] crispy_chicken: That's fair, but at least in this work he makes constant reference to how it's composed of non-communicating entities that are spontaneously coordinating. I don't know how the median NRx or Alt-right dude talks about this stuff, because I really have no idea about that world, but I think at least Moldbug is aware and makes that clear.
[1:52 PM] crispy_chicken: In fact, that's what point 4 is about!
[1:53 PM] snav:
in this work he makes constant reference to how it's composed of non-communicating entities that are spontaneously coordinating
that's cool, but most people I see who reference "the cathedral" on Twitter use it as a singular agent
[1:53 PM] snav: in fact, i pretty much never see people do otherwise
[1:53 PM] crispy_chicken: fair, I've literally never seen the cathedral referenced anywhere
[1:53 PM] crispy_chicken: I learned about Moldbug here
[1:53 PM] crispy_chicken: so I just don't have exposure
[1:54 PM] crispy_chicken: I strongly agree that the Cathedral is not a cognitively coordinated entity
[1:56 PM] crispy_chicken: 4. Because of the space the cathedral occupies, it is self-propagating. This is not intentional, it's a matter of spontaneous coordination, because over time the things that protect the cathedral win due to selection. This would not happen in any situation, it happens because the Cathedral is already in power. How did the Cathedral get into power? Weeee, that's a long one, but the argument boils down to: spontaneous coordination leads to powerful coordinating powers eventually having historical power, and the equalizing force tends to destroy the old order. But that's way too general—Moldbug isn't tied to it as an inevitably, at least in my reading, so much as very likely because of the historical circumstances.
[1:57 PM] suspended reason:
that's cool, but most people I see who reference "the cathedral" on Twitter use it as a singular agent
@snav This is a steelmanning chat!!
[1:57 PM] suspended reason: We don't let telephonic semantic-inflaters get in our way!
[1:57 PM] crispy_chicken: 5. Because information legitimacy comes from the Cathedral, it is very difficult to fight it. Of course, elements of the cathedral "fight" but those fights tend to reinforce and raise the baseline agreement in the current forces. Think about the escalation around the discourse around racism now. Or the escalation around gay marriage in the last two decades.
[1:57 PM] suspended reason: If we're gonna give that to Hegel and Foucault, we should extend it to Yarvin!
[1:57 PM] snav: it's a poorly engineered concept
[1:57 PM] snav: I've read Yarvin's texts
[1:57 PM] suspended reason: I think you're being selectively charitable
[1:58 PM] snav: part of it is my disdain for Yarvin's "project"
[1:58 PM] suspended reason: spontaneous organization is the entire lesson of [[ethnomethodology]]; it's totally plausible and indeed a better explanation than top-down coordination for most complex systems
[1:58 PM] suspended reason: it's all over the natural world too: the way flocks of birds or fish spontaneously self-organize
[1:58 PM] suspended reason: what's Yarvin's project?
[1:59 PM] snav: NRx neo-monarchy
[1:59 PM] crispy_chicken: Replace the U.S. government with a for-proft enterprise run by a CEO and a board, where all weapons only work with cryptographic authorization, so coercion can be systematized
[1:59 PM] snav: if you want i will reread his texts and write a more real critique
[2:00 PM] crispy_chicken: I would personally love that, but don't feel pressured into doing it
[2:00 PM] suspended reason:
This is not intentional, it's a matter of spontaneous coordination, because over time the things that protect the cathedral win due to selection.
Wow, yeah, this is basically my understanding of how a police force becomes corrupted, which is great as an institutional explanation because it doesn't take sides on the object-level, but rather holds that this is just how institutions work, and whatever "geist" or spirit inhabits it will embody the behavior
[2:00 PM] suspended reason: also, I think we can separate accuracy of diagnosis from tenability of treatment
[2:01 PM] suspended reason: and to be fair, trying to bootstrap the beginnings of a different approach is always gonna have huge problems
[2:01 PM] suspended reason: because it's the discursive process over time that makes the approach stronger
[2:02 PM] crispy_chicken: I agree. But to be fair to Snav, Yarvin thinks it needs to happen all at once which creates a sense of urgency in the reader. To be fair to Yarvin, he specifically talks at length about how useless violence, supporting the outer party, etc. is
[2:02 PM] suspended reason: does Yarvin ever talk Kuran-style [[preference falsification]], or weaponized sacredness?
[2:02 PM] suspended reason: I can't stand St Rev but that's one of his best ideas
[2:03 PM] crispy_chicken: Oh yeah
[2:03 PM] crispy_chicken: I think you should read this TBH
[2:03 PM] crispy_chicken: I was hesitant because it's so taboo
[2:03 PM] crispy_chicken: But it's well-written and surprisingly even handed
[2:03 PM] crispy_chicken: There are parts that are dumb
[2:03 PM] crispy_chicken: And I do think Yarvin is more racist than he admits
[2:04 PM] crispy_chicken: But I think that's about, 0.01% of the racism I have seen him accused of after looking up what people thought of him
[2:07 PM] crispy_chicken: 6. Because the Cathedral controls the information landscape, it is self-legitimazing due to how we view history. For example, there tends to be a belief that the '60s civil rights movement failed in many of its ambitions. This is certainly true of its most intense ambitions, but ultimately the ability for a minority of the population to enact change in this case was huge! But people who create media, who are largely in line with our spontaneously emergent notion of the Cathedral, are attached to a narrative of being the underdog and that narrative is very effective at forming coalitions and propagating itself in the next generation.
[2:09 PM] suspended reason: maybe my steelman of the Yarvin project is this: he was able to break one of our greatest cultural sacrednesses, the superiority of democracy, and get people talking about the advantages of autocratic or technocratic rule
[2:09 PM] suspended reason: I don't think we should replace democracy with auto-technocracy
[2:09 PM] suspended reason: but the conversation is very healthy to have
[2:09 PM] suspended reason: it allows an admission of democracy's weaknesses, which is crucial to fixing them
[2:09 PM] suspended reason: if you live in a world where democracy just is the best system, it effectively has a monopoly
[2:10 PM] suspended reason: ideologies should have to compete constantly
[2:10 PM] suspended reason: and justify themselves over other ideologies or systems
[2:10 PM] suspended reason: the reason free speech is so important, as my new hero JS Mill writes, is that it's the only system for steering the ship when it gets off-course
[2:11 PM] suspended reason: point #6 seems key here
[2:11 PM] suspended reason: our whole sense of "this is what has worked and done good historically" comes from it
[2:11 PM] suspended reason: the entire legitimation of the current moment comes from the 20th C's activist history
[2:11 PM] suspended reason: and the narrative of a progressive movement toward equality, in which activism has profound and positive effects
[2:12 PM] suspended reason: it's totally possible this is "just the way things are," and that recent history is a strange post-historical perversion of the old system, a narrative cannibalizing its hosts, but I also can't take it without a grain of salt anymore
[2:13 PM] suspended reason: I should read a history of the 20th C from a well-regarded conservative historian; it's one of the few disciplines (along with maybe econ and law?) that has any kind of real representation among conservatives, though "real representation" here means 15-25% of members are right-leaning, rather than like 1% in the rest of the humanities
[2:13 PM] crispy_chicken: yeah, I've been thinking about this too
[2:14 PM] crispy_chicken: Just reading history and really digging into what primary documents get us and what people are saying seems really important
[2:14 PM] crispy_chicken: I also am very effected by the fact that I would very likely be kicked out of my current gig if it was openly known that I read Yarvin...but no one would admit a priori that there's anything I could read that would get me kicked out.
[2:14 PM] crispy_chicken: That seems like a cult.
2:19 PM] suspended reason: really? you think they'd have the grounds to expel a student for his reading?
[2:19 PM] suspended reason: that's really wild
[2:20 PM] suspended reason: I mean, the fact you subjectively feel that way is enough to assume the pressure "works" on people; the implicit threat or fear need not be actualized to prevent open-mindedness
[2:20 PM] crispy_chicken: I don't think they'd say it's reading
[2:20 PM] crispy_chicken: they'd say
[2:20 PM] crispy_chicken: "Crispy makes people uncomfortable in their offices. That doesn't fit without our mission statement or HR policy."
[2:21 PM] crispy_chicken: But, yeah, quite frankly I would be terrified if someone found out I was reading Yarvin

[2:21 PM] suspended reason: damn.
[2:22 PM] suspended reason: this is why I think "The Cathedral" is a good concept handle, not a bad one
[2:22 PM] suspended reason: sure, it has implications of agency on its own
[2:23 PM] suspended reason: but that kind of confusion is true of lots of processes: look at the way even evolutionary biologists treat "evolution" as an agent
[2:23 PM] suspended reason: personifying and reifying a disparate process into an agentic one is human nature
[2:23 PM] suspended reason: but the idea that the liberal order--which is on its face, or object-level, totally anti-religious-- is enacting its own kind of sacredness order is a key one
[2:23 PM] suspended reason: which is maybe why the nod to Catholicism in medieval scholarship felt appropriate the other day (answering your Q a few days late)
[2:24 PM] suspended reason: that's not a new or original take tho, it's one I've seen used quite a bit, and usually there's aggressive discussion as to whether heretics were really burned at the stake for their ideas about the cosmos, or whether it was cuz they also believed in alchemy and the occult.

## Amhari 2017: The New Phillistines

> The word ‘beauty’ isn’t part of [contemporary art's] lexicon. Sincerity, formal rigour and cohesion, the quest for truth, the sacred and the transcendent – none of these concerns, once thought timeless, is on the radar among the artists and critics who rule the contemporary art scene. These ideals have all been thrust aside to make room for the art world’s one totem, its alpha and omega: identity politics.

> as the American critic Camille Paglia has written, artists today ‘are too often addressing other artists and the in-group of hip cognoscenti’. (_note: see "field autonomy" to Bourdieu_)

> Identitarian art rarely manages to raise marginalised and ‘subaltern’ voices. Doing so successfully requires really listening to such voices in all their rich complexity – whereas identitarian art usually searches for subaltern props with which to bash the ‘dominant’ culture.

> Both insist that certain protagonists should be presented in the cultural foreground, always in a noble frame. For Socialist art, it was workers, farmers and communist apparats joining hands to build a classless society. For identitarian art, the revered subjects are women, racial and sexual minorities victimised by and/or bravely resisting patriarchy, heteronormativity and other Western depredations

> The trouble, then as now, is that this way of thinking about art denies individuality and [[agency]] to these groups. They become political types, stand-ins for ideological causes, almost always left wing, rather than individual souls, fallen like all of us but possessed of a free will and therefore responsible for their destinies.

## Artforum's identity issue
> For its summer 2016 special issue, Artforum selected the theme of ‘Art and Identity’. It was an odd if telling choice: every Artforum issue is more or less an identity issue. Identity politics is the lens through which the magazine views not just what happens in the arts, but in the world at large.

> The first thing to note about Artforum’s debate on identity politics is that there was no debate.

## Emma Rice directorship of the Globe Theater

> There would be plenty of rules. For starters, all productions would have to strive for, and eventually achieve, 50/50 gender parity among actors onstage, regardless of the ramifications for storytelling, performance or meaning.

> For Rice, directing on Shakespeare’s stage would be a fundamentally political enterprise. It would be about winning and using ‘power’ to promote feminist ends and ‘smash down’ opponents, including the Bard himself.

> As she told The Guardian, ‘I have tried to sit down with Shakespeare but it doesn’t work. I get very sleepy and then suddenly I want to listen to The Archers’, the long-running BBC radio soap. She added: ‘He was writing 400 years ago, there is no way in the world every line can still be relevant.’

> many of those who claim to enjoy Shakespeare are faking it, Rice concluded. ‘I think there’s a lot of Emperor’s New Clothes in theatre,’ she told the Telegraph. ‘Nobody wants to be the one who doesn’t understand it so nobody says they don’t. I feel that then becomes a conspiracy.’

> A Bollywood-style dance number set to Beyoncé’s ‘Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)’ came early on, and the audience was treated to a rendition of the late David Bowie’s ‘Space Oddity’ during the Rude Mechanicals’ play-within-a-play.

> As early reviews pointed out, Rice’s framing of the flower juice as Shakespearean roofies also clashed with the rest of the production’s moral logic. Elsewhere, Rice invited us to celebrate the desire-shifting effects of the same flower juice. Oberon’s potion, after all, brings Demetrius and Helena together, when in ‘sobriety’ the former violently rejected the latter

> Rice’s coming-out narrative short-circuited the Bard’s themes, themes that resonate with all of us, regardless of sexual orientation, because they are timeless and universal. In Rice’s hands, they indeed became just another ‘contemporary issue to explore’.
