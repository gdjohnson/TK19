# Cassius: The Life of Cassius Marcellus Clay

> I selected for my office a brick building, and lined the outside doors with sheet-iron, to prevent it being burned. I purchased two brass 4-pounder cannon at Cincinnati, and placed them, loaded with shot and nails, on a table breast high; had folding doors secured with a chain, which which could open upon the mob and give play to my canon. I furnished my office with Mexican lances, and a limited number of guns. There were six or eight persons who stood ready to defend me. If defeated they were to escape by a trap door in the roof; and I had placed a keg of powder, with a match, which I would set off and blow up the office and all my invaders. This I should most certainly have done in case of the last extremity.

# [[Tanner Greer]] 2020: On Sparks Before the Prairie Fire

> The outbreak of the War of 1812 led to anti-Federalist agitation across the country, and much of that was violent. One of the most dramatic of these was siege of Baltimore's sole Federalist newspaper, a siege which ended with one Republican shot dead, nine Federalists beat senseless, another beaten dead, and a last set on fire.

> Strange as they may be today, attacks on the press are a staple of American history. The three episodes discussed above are a mere sampling from a violent dispensation that began in colonial era and did not subside until 1970s. Between that time there were hundreds of attacks on presses, writers, and editors. 

> Ours is a bloody history. Journalists and pamphleteers were hardly the sole, or even the favored, targets of American bloodlust. Over the course of American history treaties prompted street brawls, bank laws birthed riots, epidemics spawned civil strife, and both abolitionists and slave catchers were met by angry mobs. Less sectional than the mobbing surrounding the slave question, but no less violent, were mob attacks on Catholics, Mormons, Irish, Germans, Mexicans, and Blacks. To this ethnic and religious strife might be added the myriad strikes and labor confrontations that careened into violence. Extra-legal vigilance committees numbering in the thousands have, at one time or another, been charged with keeping the peace in every region of this country. Armed rebellions have seized both city and state governments. Democrats, Whigs, Know-nothings, and Republicans have all murdered and bludgeoned to keep their opponents away from the ballot box.

# Lincoln 1838: The Perpetuation of Our Political Insitutions 

> Accounts of outrages committed by mobs, form the every-day news of the times. They have pervaded the country, from New England to Louisiana;—they are neither peculiar to the eternal snows of the former, nor the burning suns of the latter; they are not the creature of climate—neither are they confined to the slave-holding, or the non-slave-holding States. Alike, they spring up among the pleasure hunting masters of Southern slaves, and the order loving citizens of the land of steady habits. Whatever, then, their cause may be, it is common to the whole country.
