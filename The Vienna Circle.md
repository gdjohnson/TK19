A. W. Carus, _Carnap and Twentieth Century Thought_:
> When Carnap moved to Vienna in 1926, he found the Circle studying the *Tractatus* line by line. ‘[[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]]’s book exerted a strong influence upon our Circle’, Carnap later wrote; ‘we learned much by our discussions of the book, and accepted many views as far as we could assimilate them to our basic conceptions’ (1963, p. 24). ‘The thinking of our Circle was strongly influenced by Wittgenstein’s ideas, first because of our common reading of the *Tractatus* and later by virtue of Waismann’s systematic exposition of certain conceptions of Wittgenstein’s on the basis of his talks with him’ (1963).

## Rejection of logic as about the world; rejection of metaphysics

> Though [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] adopted Frege’s and Russell’s all-encompassing conception of logic as universally applicable and inescapable, he rejected the view that the logical laws were laws of something in the world out there (something like the most general laws of nature, or the laws of thought). For Wittgenstein, logical laws were not laws of something; they were just an artefact or by-product of isomorphic representation. Certain concatenations of propositions come out true (or false) regardless of what facts hold; these are ‘tautologous’ (or contradictory) and empty. They say nothing whatever about the world. The Vienna Circle thought this idea of critical importance.

Carnap on [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]], 1963:
> The most important insight I gained from his work was the conception that the truth of logical statements is based only on their logical structure and on the meaning of the terms. Logical statements are true under all conceivable circumstances; thus their truth is independent of contingent facts of the world. On the other hand, it follows that these statements do not say anything about the world and thus have no factual content

And 1930:
> As all sentences of logic are tautological and empty of content, nothing can be deduced from them about what reality must be like and cannot be like. The justification for every metaphysics based on logic, like the large-format one put forward by Hegel, is thus taken away.

A. W. Carus:
> This is a recurring motif in Vienna Circle writings at this time. In the programmatic pamphlet *Wissenschaftliche Weltauffassung*, for instance, metaphysics is found to suffer from two fundamental mistakes. The first is its uncritical use of the categories and the surface grammar of ordinary language—its reification of verbal illusions, embedded in everyday categories, that disappear upon analysis. The second ‘fundamental mistake of metaphysics’ is the ‘conception that thought could either lead to knowledge by itself, without using any sort of empirical content, or that it could at least by deduction arrive at new contents from given facts’.
