Many of the concepts we associate with French theory are in fact laundered cybernetic, [[game theory|game-theoretic]], and [[information theory|information-theoretic]] ideas, twice-translated: the information-theoretic importance of difference (that makes a difference); the top-down [[social construction|construction of reality]]; Lacanian game theories (jeu); Deleuzean feedback. (For more, see Lydia H. Liu, "The Cybernetic Unconscious: Rethinking Lacan, Poe, and French Theory.")

> Wiener wrote fiction, corresponded with [[T. S. Eliot]], and he even published his own literary criticism, including a substantial article on [[Rudyard Kipling]]. Shannon wrote critically about [[Edgar Allen Poe|Poe]]’s essay “Maelzel’s Chess-Player” but not much else, although he did bring up [[James Joyce’]]s [[_Finnegans Wake_]] during the experimental work he carried out on information theory. [[Alan Turing]] enacted a series of botched hide-and-seek games when he tried to imitate Captain Kidd of “The Gold Bug” to bury his silver bars and banknotes in the countryside during World War II.
