"it was 1969, little improvised bombs detonating across Manhattan, perpetual campus protests; there was outrage, but also a sense of community, of carnival; we felt that history was alive" (Ben Lerner, _The Topeka School_)

Jerry Garcia:
> It was about possibilities...Everyone was waiting, this sense of something is about to happen. Everybody knew it, everybody was waiting... something was gonna happen, then everybody did what they could to make it happen.

## Image and Authenticity

### Simon Reynolds 2016, Shock & Awe:

The Sixties were the decade of image, from Bergman's _Persona_ to Sontag's camp to Muriel Spark's _The Public Image_. Reynolds traces the interest to [[Erving Goffman]]'s 1959 _The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life_ and Daniel Boorstin's 1962 _The Image_, which talked of "the menace of unreality" in an increasingly mediated world of photo ops, publicity stunts, and celebrity—a proto-Baudrillardean, proto-hypernormalisation take.

> This negative concept of the 'image' that spread during the sixties was part of a rowing view of public life as a realm of falsehood and facade. Against this rallied the conviction that 'the truth will set you free'—the motor behind nearly all the forms of bohemian expression and radical dissent that bubbled up during that decade.

> This compulsion to show and say the unpretty truth had first started to stir in the mid-fifties, with the Angry Young Men playwrights and novelists in Britain, and the Beats in America. Fellow travellers in America included Norman Mailer and Jackson Pollock, whose 'I am Nature' spontaneity splashed across his canvases (but also into the fireplace of his benefactor Peggy Guggenheim when he unzipped and urinated during a dinner party). Teenage Holden Caulfield in _The Catcher in the Rye_ rails constantly against the phoniness of grown-ups, a plaint echoed within a few years by Bob Dylan with "All is phony." However, the patron anti-saint of the "truth will set you free" era was not a painter, poet or rock singer, but a comedian. Lenny Bruce's brand of stand-up wasn't just about blue jokes but about standing up for his right to say whatever he wanted... Bruce worshipped "the gods of Spontaneity, Candor and Free Association," seeing himself as the comedy equivalent of Charlie Parker. His improvised routines approached automatic writing.

> a post-Method school of actors and directors aspired to a de-theatricalised form of naturalistic acting, all mumbling and tics, that inevitably spawned a new set of mannerisms that today look as stagey and trapped in time as the Hollywood golden age of poise and elocution. In all the arts, in fact, every attempt of realism, no matter how stringently stripped down or crude, seems to birth a new repertoire of stylised conventions and stock gestures. Bowie, for one, was acutely aware of this in relation to rock, which he precociously grapsed was a _performance_ of real-ness rather than a straightforward presentation of reality onstage. 

> Flashpoints in the feminist war against illusion included protests at beauty contests such as Miss America 1968, where Women's Liberation activists hurled bras and make-up into a Freedom Trash Can.

Hair, with its associations to an "Edenic wilderness," became a potent symbol of "natural honesty" in the decade, alongside nudity, which became increasingly prominent in theater productions (_Dionysus in 69_, _Paradise Now_) and music (Woodstock, Lennon & Yoko for _Two Virgins_ cover). Lennon entered his "primal scream" era, and put out the protest song "Gimme Some Truth."

## Croce 1994: Discussing the Undiscussable

> I'll say one thing for the sixties: the dance profession flourished in a climate of aesthetic freedom it hasn't enjoyed since. Jones's main connection to the sixties experimenters was to the power they'd claimed to control the terms on which they could be artists and be written about as artists. [...] Members of the sixties generation, seeing themselves as picking up where Merce Cunningham's revolution left off, had decided that walking and other forms of non- dance locomotion were in fact dancing. Their authority was John Cage more than it was Cunningham (who continued to use pure-dance movement), and for a few years there was lively controversy in New York over the direction of the new postmodern (as it was then not yet called) modern dance.

## Glass: Words Without Music

> New York [in 1967] looked much the same as when I had left it in 1964, but my generation, now in its late twenties and early thirties, felt an energy that seemed to pervade the entire city. In only a few years, the Beats had become the hippies, while the dreamers had reawakened as activists. Woodstock was just two years away, and a new electric popular music set out the beat for everyone. The scene at Berkeley was very much a part of our energy system, a second pole of active creativity as it were.

# Rebellion, nature, and ideology

"there were at least two distinct movements within the counterculture. The first, the New Left, did politics to change politics. Its members formed parties, organised committees, marched. The second, which I will call the New Communalists, turned away from politics and toward consciousness as the engine of social change." (Fred Turner, _Uncube_)

## De Landa Destratified

De Landa:

> Deleuze and Guattari emphasize over and over that once you take the route of destratification, there’s an inherent danger that it will turn fantastic, that it will turn against itself. For them, certain aspects of Nazism were very destratified – for instance, Nazi tactics. That’s why they beat the shit out of everyone. And yet there was this smell of death there – the holocaust. They were destratifying themselves, but they bounced off the wall and restratifed themselves in a much more gross, evil, and resentful way, lacking joy in the worst way.

> I just saw the Doors movie. Jim Morrison just tried to break on through to the other side too fast, thinking that all you had to do was take more and more acid. When you can’t break through anymore, when you bounce off it, you become resentful and turn to death. You won’t find that world of purity that you were expecting, and now you become resentful and turn against yourself, turn suicidal. Deleuze and Guattari call it a black hole. You enter the wrong attractor. The 60’s were extremely destratifying, and yet, because they thought they were going to achieve everything within the 60’s – and what they wanted was not achievable, period – fringes of this motion went into the wrong track. Then you have the Weathermen, completely pathetic terrorists blowing themselves up. That’s that impatience and resentment that Deleuze and Guattari warn about.

## Paglia 1992: Junk Bonds and Corporate Raiders

> [My generation] put the myth of Dionysus into action, and we hit the wall of reality. The Sixties revolutionized consciousness, but on the road of excess by which we sought the palace of wisdom, many of us lost our minds, lives, or careers through drugs, sexual orgy, or (my vice) constant challenges to authority. The Sixties, rebelling against Fifties bourgeois conformity and respectability, took life to its extreme and explored the far edges of the possible. Altamont (December 1969) was our Waterloo: there the Dionysian forces released by the Sixties showed their ugly face... the end of Sixties illusions about the benevolence of human nature and mother nature.

## Paglia 1992: Sexual Personae The Cancelled Preface

> The trauma of the Sixties persuaded me that my generation's egalitarianism was a sentimental error. I now see the hierarchical as both beautiful and necessary. Efficiency liberates; egalitarianism tangles, delays, blocks, deadens.

## Kael 1974: The Current Cinema

> [Cassavetes's Woma Under The Influence] is based on the idea that the crazy person is endowed with a clarity of vision that the warped society can't tolerate, and so is persecuted. [R.D.] Laing's approach is a natural for movies at this time, since the view that society is insane has so much to recommend it that people may easily fall for the next reversal that those whom this society judges insane are the truly sane. 

> Laing has given modern weight to a persistent, emotionally appealing myth, and his books, such as the campus favorite _The Politics of Experience_, tell counterculture readers what they are already disposed to believe. For those who feel blocked or ineffectual, the view that the good are the victims of the family and of society's other authoritarian structures can be wonderfully satisfying. It's the furthest extension of the line taken by William Inge and Elia Kazan in the 1961 _Splendor in the Grass_. In that simplistic Freudian film, the adults, who had lost the ability to love, frustrated their children; the adolescents (Warren Beatty and Natalie Wood) weren't allowed to consummate their passion, and as a result she lost him and went crazy.

> By the end of the sixties, the division of the world into bullies and victims had become an article of faith for much of the counterculture.

> Mabel Longhetti is basically spontaneous and joyful, but only children respond to her on her own terms. Every impulse she has is denied, and she's stampeded into madness by her violently irascible husband. [...] It's never suggested that there's something wrong with Mabel for not getting herself together. Others reduce her to pulp; she's not a participant in her own destruction. [...] Yet even in this season when victimization is the hottest thing in the movie market this scapegoat heroine doesn't do a damn thing for him.

# Generational churn

## Levin 2017: Fractured Republic

> We see our recent history through the boomers’ eyes. Were the 1950s really simple and wholesome? Were the 1960s really idealistic and rebellious? Were the 1970s aimless and anxious? Did we find our footing in the 1980s? Become comfortable and confident in the 1990s? Or more fearful and disoriented over the past decade and a half? As we shall see in the coming chapters, the answer in each case is not simply yes or no. But it is hard to deny that we all frequently view the postwar era in this way—through the lens of the boomer experience.

> [The boomer] rebelled against the world he knew as a young man, but now it stands revealed to him as a paradise lost.

> The 1950s did not seem like an age of innocent idyll or bland conformity to the adults who lived through it. It was a decade when intellectual life was still attempting to come to terms with the horrors of World War II and the Holocaust. Consider a few famous book titles:  Orwell's 1984 (published 1949), Hersey's The Wall (1950), Arendt's The Origins of Totalitarianism (1951), Chambers' Witness (1952), Miller's The Crucible (1953), Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 (1953), Golding's Lord of the Flies (1954), Pasternak's Doctor Zhivago (1957), and Shirer's Rise and Fall of the Third Reich (1960) were all intensely preoccupied with the weaknesses of liberalism and the allure of totalitarian solutions.... And that is all without considering a lost war in Korea, the tension of the larger Cold War, and the tumult of the Civil Rights revolution. We may think of the 1950s as an age of conformity, purity, and stability, but those who lived through it as adults experienced it as an age of fragmentation, permissiveness, and shattered innocence.

# New York & midcentury intellectual culture

<-- Todo: Lionel Trilling and literary celebrity, via Ed Mendelson -->

> If the old world of magazines was a state of war, then New York was the main battleground. Magazine warfare was intimate and intense because of the similarities between the combatants and the limited territory which they contested. The quintessential New York conflict was fought between the New York Intellectuals of Partisan Review, Commentary, Dissent and the New York Review of Books, “a feisty, battling community”(9) who would eviscerate each other in their magazines and at each others cocktail parties all over the Upper West Side during the 1950s and 60s. The political and cultural distinctions being contested were so subtle and arcane that they could look absurd to the uninitiated (“I heard that Commentary and Dissent had merged and formed Dysentery,” quipped Alvy Singer in Annie Hall), but this only made the fighting more fierce.
