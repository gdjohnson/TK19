[[C.S. Peirce]]: "The elements of every concept enter into logical thought at the gate of perception and make their exit at the gate of purposive action; and whatever cannot show its passports at both those two gates is to be arrested as unauthorized by reason."

J. Ryde on Bateson's challenge of the epistemology/ontology distinction:
> I am also challenging dualism and choose a non-dualistic epistemology to do it. To do so I need to recognise life as a ‘seamless web’ (Bateson 1982). Bateson acknowledged that, because we are human and think in the way that we do, we must inevitably apply analytic scissors to this web in order to live the life we can understand and reflect upon (Bateson and Bateson 1987:145). By this he meant that, although all is connected and whole rather than in parts, we, being human, inevitably see the world in separate pieces – we cut the seamless web in order to understand it.

# Pragmatic perception
To Bergson, one perceives _in order to act_, and one sees the world as a set of obstacles and affordances to the body:

# Functional Decision Categories

[[David Chapman]] 2019: *The Eggplant*:

> We use words as tools to get things done; and to get things done, we improvise, making use of whatever materials are ready to hand. If you want to whack a piece of sheet metal to bend it, and don’t know or care what the “right” tool is (if there even is one), you might take a quick look around the garage, grab a large screwdriver at the “wrong” end, and hit the target with its hard rubber handle.

And yet, at the core of linguistics is an "intellectualist philosophy," [[Bourdieu]] writes in _Language & Symbolic Power_: a philosophy which "treats language as an object of contemplation rather than as an instrument of action and power.""

Often, these human purposes are reified. [[William James]] 1890: *Principles of Psychology*:

> Our usual purpose with [a thing], our commonest title for it, and the properties which this title suggests, have in reality nothing sacramental. They characterize us more than they characterize the thing. But we are so stuck in our prejudices, so petrified intellectually, that to our vulgarest names, with their suggestions, we ascribe an eternal and exclusive worth. [...] we end by believing that to conceive them in those ways is to conceive them in the only true way. Those are no truer ways of conceiving them than any others; they are only more important ways, more frequently serviceable ways.

[2:24 PM] Natural Hazard: @suspended reason I'm brainstorming different language for "Pragmatic Ontologies". I think that's actually a pretty good phrase, but I a more down to earth version as well
[2:25 PM] Natural Hazard: I used to call these "Functional Decision Categories" but that's a shit name with several ambiguities (a category's logic is rooted in helping you make a decision that fits v functionally into your life)
[2:26 PM] Natural Hazard: "Goal directed categories"
[2:26 PM] Natural Hazard: "Purposeful categories"
[2:26 PM] Natural Hazard: "Purposeful carvings"
[2:27 PM] Natural Hazard: maybe just "Pragmatic Categorizations"
[2:44 PM] suspended reason: I like all these terms!
[2:44 PM] suspended reason: FDC is pretty self-explanatory in a nice way
[2:44 PM] suspended reason: and I guess I'm a lil worried by the blurriness between "ontology" and "epistemology" and "taxonomy" in philosophy
[2:45 PM] suspended reason: I feel like we'll make people mad at us for using ontology that way, potentially
[2:45 PM] suspended reason: Curious @snav thoughts
[2:46 PM] suspended reason: Ontology "includes the questions of how entities are grouped into basic categories" (wiki) but is also a metaphysical branch
[2:46 PM] Natural Hazard: Yeah, so I think the CS/infosys def of ontology we're totally in line with. The more philosophical ontology I think we're askew of
[2:47 PM] suspended reason: seems right
[2:47 PM] Natural Hazard: I was just thinking about ontology vs taxonomy (again from infosys angle) and I think taxonomy carries the idea of parent child relationships, subtypes, and general hierarchy, where ontology is more free form "here's the stuff! here's how some of them relate"
[10:13 AM] snav: yeah this is the 1980s compsci usage of ontology which i wish would die
[10:14 AM] snav: why not "schemata"?
[10:15 AM] snav: if you explain a bit more what the thing is, then i can probably suggest other ideas
[11:59 AM] Natural Hazard: I'm totally down for schema/schemata. I think I might already use that in some places
[12:01 PM] Natural Hazard: Lol, yeah this is obviously it https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_(psychology)
Schema (psychology)
In psychology and cognitive science, a schema (plural schemata or schemas) describes a pattern of thought or behavior that organizes categories of information and the relationships among them. It can also be described as a mental structure of preconceived ideas, a framework representing some aspect of the world, or a system of organizing and per...
[12:02 PM] Natural Hazard: Can you try and explain more what Phil/metaphysics ontology is? And how it's different from something like "a schema that someone declares as normative"?
[12:33 PM] suspended reason: I think schema is leaning on the cognitive whereas ontology leans on the metaphysical
[12:33 PM] suspended reason: The categories I use vs The nature of being
[12:34 PM] suspended reason: But I'm not super read up on metaphysics
[12:37 PM] snav: i will explain in a bit, on a call
[3:00 PM] snav: ontology is basically the study of "what exists" i.e. the study of "things" but on a fundamental/metaphysical level as graham says
[3:00 PM] snav: so in this sense it's tangled up with epistemology, because the question of "what exists" is tangled up with the question of "what do we know exists"
[3:01 PM] snav: at least, in a post-Kantian world.
[3:02 PM] snav: but for the ancients, or Plato at least, ontology was about "what properties can we attribute to all things" so that you can know "of" the thing without "knowing the thing", e.g. i know that you have some sort of internal mental representation, but i can't know what it is. this is related to the idea of "possibility of knowledge" which is what Kant's categories are a response to (i.e., i might not know how much you weigh, but i know that "all things have a weight" so i can know at least that this knowledge is possible)
[3:02 PM] snav: so for Plato the most basic ontological notion was that of "being", which is a sort of fundamental property that all things "partake in" insofar as they "exist"
[3:05 PM] snav: so like. when we talk about a software ontology, yknow it's sort of the same thing in that it's about defining categories which constructs can partake in, but ontology as its used in philosophy necessarily applies to "everything" rather than being bounded by a human-constructed space of things

[11:06 AM] suspended reason: I think there's a conflict here, in developing good concept handles
[11:06 AM] suspended reason: OTOH, the idea is that our schemas of "what exists" just are pragmatic, built to get things done
[11:06 AM] suspended reason: Here, saying a "pragmatic schema" or "pragmatic ontology" is redundant
[11:07 AM] suspended reason: You can't actually convey or "tokenize" the idea that our schematic ontologies are pragmatic
[11:07 AM] suspended reason: Because it "should" just be built into the concept already (it isn't)
