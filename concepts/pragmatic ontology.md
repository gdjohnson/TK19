[[David Chapman]] 2019: *The Eggplant*:

> We use words as tools to get things done; and to get things done, we improvise, making use of whatever materials are ready to hand. If you want to whack a piece of sheet metal to bend it, and don’t know or care what the “right” tool is (if there even is one), you might take a quick look around the garage, grab a large screwdriver at the “wrong” end, and hit the target with its hard rubber handle.

And yet, at the core of linguistics is an "intellectualist philosophy," [[Bourdieu]] writes in _Language & Symbolic Power_: a philosophy which "treats language as an object of contemplation rather than as an instrument of action and power.""


Often, these human purposes are reified. [[William James]] 1890: *Principles of Psychology*:

> Our usual purpose with [a thing], our commonest title for it, and the properties which this title suggests, have in reality nothing sacramental. They characterize us more than they characterize the thing. But we are so stuck in our prejudices, so petrified intellectually, that to our vulgarest names, with their suggestions, we ascribe an eternal and exclusive worth. [...] we end by believing that to conceive them in those ways is to conceive them in the only true way. Those are no truer ways of conceiving them than any others; they are only more important ways, more frequently serviceable ways.
