_Parts hide one another; and when the artifact is completed the activity that fits them together disappears completely._ (Bruno Latour)

Fitness, or "fit," refers to the quality of two or more things being complimentary, harmonious, or interlocking. Fit refers specifically to a relationship between parts. Used first by Christopher Alexander in _Notes on the Synthesis of Form_, and taken up again by [[Sarah Perry]] in her _Ribbonfarm_ essays, "fit" is less a new way of understanding artistic composition and more an abstraction of existing theories of composition and art. It originates in the observation that traditionally understood elements of composition like "unity," "balance," "rhythm," "pattern," and "contrast" are variations on the quality of complimentary interlock between disparate parts — then takes it further, observing as well that interlock exists not just between the parts of a work, or between part and whole, but also between whole and audience, whole and culture, whole and context, be it cultural, situational, artistic, or historical.

"Fit" embodies the role of context and of identity-through-interaction—almost all human cultural inventions are both “objective” and “subjective,” have their power emerge from the interaction _between_ subject and object, as Dewey characterizes the work of art: an emerging encounter; fit. [Beauty is fit](https://carcinisation.com/2014/08/11/beauty-is-fit/), as [[Sarah Perry]] writes at _Carcinisation_, echoing this factoring of Dewey’s. But morality, too, is a system of fit between code and culture, and culture is a fit between individuals and between individual and world.

Most simply: _fit is a demarcation of appropriateness between part and whole_.

# Folk parlance

Words for fit within systems: appropriateness, beauty, comfort, propriety, etiquette, envelopment. Something feels "natural"; could be no other way; is "just right" (the Goldilocks zone) or "felicitous." The appropriate is and feels "correct" and "harmonious," as opposed to "wrong," "slighty off" and dischordant. 

# Design

## Christopher Alexander, Notes on the Synthesis of Form

> [E]very design problem begins with an effort to achieve fitness between two entities: the form in question and its context. The form is the solution to the problem; the context defines the problem. In other words, when we speak of design, the real object of discussion is not the form alone, but the ensemble comprising the form and its context. Good fit is a desired property of this ensemble which relates to some particular division of the ensemble into form and context... 

> There is a wide variety of ensembles which we can talk about like this. The biological ensemble made up of a natural organism and its physical environment is the most familiar: in this case we are used to describing the fit between the two as well-adaptedness. But the same kind of objective aptness is to be found in many other situations. The ensemble consisting of a suit and tie is a familiar case in point; one tie goes well with a certain suit, another goes less well.

> Works have fitness with their historical, social, and cultural contexts. Moreover, there is a fitness between a work and its presentation (though one might view presentation as merely an extension of the work itself, or as a mediator between work and context). Alan Kaprow on Happenings, The Blurring of Art and Life: "An orientation has proved not only useful but necessary, since invariably no one knows how to deal with such a project."  The extractive critic, if talented, can make otherwise useless or "ugly" works useful or beautiful by shifting framing or orientation, by changing the way we see, read, listen to, or otherwise approach it.

## Noë 2012: Strange Tools

> Tools are useful only against the background of our needs and capacities. Let’s return to the doorknob. A simple bit of technology, yes, but one that presupposes a vast and remarkable social background. Doorknobs exist in the context of a whole form of life, a whole biology—the existence of doors, and buildings, and passages, the human body, the hand, and so on. A designer of doorknobs makes a simple artifact, but does so with an eye to its mesh with this larger cognitive and anthropological framework.

# Art

Perry discusses modernist and avant art production in terms of its target fitness moving away from "human nervous systems" and toward "increasingly rarified abstract cultural systems":

> Cage’s music is an example of the tendency for high-[[status]] human domains to ignore fit with human nervous systems in favor of fit with increasingly rarified abstract cultural systems. Human nervous systems are limited. Representation of existing forms, and generating pleasure and poignancy in human minds, are often disdained as solved problems. Domains unhinged from the desires and particularities of human nervous systems and bodies become inhuman; human flourishing, certainly, is not a solved problem. However, human nervous systems themselves create and seek out “fit” of the more abstract sort; the domain of abstract systems is part of the natural human environment and the forms that exist there interact with humans as symbiotes.

Fit reflects a fairly obvious fact, long known and frequently neglected: that context is not a but the mechanism of significance. In art is the dominant mechanism in how an artist imagines, executes, and presents his work; it is that which controls how an audience evaluates, understands, and interacts with that which it encounters. If a work (an utterance, an action, a thought or emotion) and its context are in combination of positive value — produce beneficial effect — we can say there is a positive fitness at play. If it is of negative effective — if in conjunction there is pain, or ugliness, or detriment — then there is misfit, poor fit, and always varying in degree. Perfect fit is the optimal match between a thing and its context; it is absolute; while imperfect fit is always a matter of degree.

We may nod placidly in assent, and yet a number of principles follow from it which run counter to common wisdom.

## Generic fit: Averaging vs. distillation

From Reason 2016, where "generic fit" references a kind of one-size-fits-all quality to a work with respect to a large target audience:

> Distillation is the process of boiling away all surface, non-essential details in order to yield common ground. The essence — what’s left over post-distillation — fits both well and widely because of its sweeping inclusivity and non-specificity. An example is the platitude or cliché; almost anyone can relate to The grass is greener on the other side as a true statement about how human perception and longing work. Platitudes in fact demand a high level of generic fit as a precondition of their survival: to become a platitude, an observation has to be so broadly applicable, or else so broadly useful, that generation after generation of humans persistently passes it down (temporal genericism).
> 
> Averaging is the process of finding, among a wide field of varying data points, a meaningful middle ground, a thing entirely different from a common ground. Middle grounds fit equally widely, but less well, as common grounds: the more standard deviations from mean an individual or context is, the worse it will fit with the center. Clothing sizes are a classic example of middle-ground fitness, as are virtually all commercial products. Even personal tailoring (counter-intuitively, since “bespoke” is essentially an antonym for “generic”) frequently exploits middle-ground genericism — cuts are altered to allow flexibility for future changes in body size or else evolving cultural fashions.1

## Map and chord fit (Duquette)

Map fit is the compressive relationship between representation and represented (territory). Chord fit is the formal relation between parts, which has as its third point human aesthetic perception (e.g. a meal is composed of parts which are pleasurable to human gustatory sense).

Situations of bad fit are often called awkward, or painful; there is a mismatch between part and whole, utterance and conversation, body and environment. Fit is frequently accompanied, at least in the ancestral (read: evolved-to-fit-within) environment, by pleasure: olfactory fit, auditory fit, visual fit (healthy vs. toxic, leisure vs. danger, and Dennett's "landscape beauty" hypothesis, respectively).

## Taste as fit

The concept is used to refactor our concept of "taste" in "Re-engineering 'Taste'" (Reason 2020), such that it is about fitness between audience and artwork, in a way that, when coupled with [[status|prestige hierarchies]], leads to a reified sense of tasteful and tasteless works:

> 1. Acts in this variety show typically are trying to do something (they have functions), and will have conventionally and idiosyncratically known means at their disposal to achieve these ends.
> 2. Audience members have varying desires and needs which they hope to satisfy in experiencing an act; they also differ, for reasons stated, in their hermeneutic frames—frames which acts rely on to achieve communicative or affective ends.
> 3. There is a ranking in the [[status|prestige]] of roles and individuals which dynamically informs and is informed by the ranking in prestige of these functions and desires. 

## The Implications of Fitness for [[Extractive Criticism]]

Works have fitness with their historical, social, and cultural contexts. It is essential we know these contexts, essential we understand the conditions in which a work arises, and essential we grasp the variety of problem which a work attempts to solve. We may be unaware of this problem and, following, therefore incapable of an awareness as to function; an Alaskan panning the idiocy of an air conditioner, Texans finding heaters redundant. _Everything is a monster till we know what it is for_.

Thus what we frequently mistake as inferior product, by regards of our "taste," is actually merely a reification of a class elevation, or of a particular (leisured, if sophisticated) relation to works.

Critics like Silverblatt and Berger are not so much “critical” critics in the sense of evaluating or passing judgment, nor are they “translator” critics, focused on giving cultural, historical, or biographical context to open up a text. Instead, they approach their work with humility, generosity, and painstaking patience; from here, they are able to share those approaches, ideas, interpretations, and “ways of seeing” which might bring out additional value from a given work. In other words, they wish to _increase_ the fitness of a work relative to the audience they write for (or, in an alternate factoring, increase the fitness of their audience to receive the work). _See [[Extractive Criticism]] for full entry._

This becomes especially salient when mere _branding_ can dramatically change a work's "fitness," by altering the values hierarchies and critical framework within which it is interpreted & understood. Maura Johnston on the music of Farrah Abraham, August 7, 2012:

> Before I first heard "Getting Up From Rock Bottom," I heard about it from all my friends and those people who I know only by their Internet bylines—"worst song ever," "ow my ears," etc., etc. But [...] If this song had been serviced to certain music outlets under a different artist name and by a particularly influential publicist, you'd probably be reading bland praise of its "electro influences" right now.

* The concept is the foundation of Gabe Duquette's "maps and chords" frame.
* The concept has been divided, in the context of artworks, into:
  * Inter-work fitness: fitness with historical & contemporary production. 
  * Intra-work fitness: fitness between parts and whole.
  * Subjective fitness: fitness between the work and audience.

# Evolution and systems theory

[[Gregory Bateson]] 1972:
> Analogous relations certainly obtain in the ecology of a redwood forest or a coral reef.  The mostfrequent or “dominant” species are likely to be nodal to constellations of other species because thesurvival of a newcomer to the system will commonly be determined by how its way of life fits withthat  of  one  or  more  dominant  species. 5  In  these  contexts—both  ecological  and  mental—the  word“fit” is a low-level analogue of “matching flexibility.” 

As a result, the less powerful organisms must "fit" themselves to the more powerful organisms.

## Ralph Waldo Emerson, Journals

__May 16 1834__

> I remember when I was a boy going upon the beach and being charmed with the colors and forms of the shells. I picked up many and put them in my pocket. When I got home I could find nothing that I gathered—nothing but some dry ugly mussel and snail shells. Thence I learned that Composition was more important than the beauty of individual forms to effect. On the shore they lay wet and social by the sea and under the sky.

__May 23 1832__

> Every thing is a monster till we know what it is for... A lobster is monstrous but when we have been shown the reason of the case & the color & the tentacula & the proportion of the claws & seen that he has not a scale nor a bristle nor any quality but fits to some habit & condition of the creature he then seems as perfect & suitable to his sea house as a glove to a hand. A man in the rocks under the sea would be a monster but a lobster is a most handy & happy fellow there.

# Meaning, Beauty, and Stimulus-Observer Fitness

## [[Robin Hanson]] on Lower & Higher Levels of Linguistic Fit

> You can think of knowing how to write as knowing how to correlate words. Given no words, what first word should you write. Then given one word, what second word best correlates with that. Then given two words, what third word best fits with those two. And so on. Thus your knowledge of how to write can be broken into what you know at these different correlation orders: one word, two words, three words, and so on. Each time you pick a new word you can combine knowledge at these different orders, by weighing all their different recommendations for your next word.

> This correlation order approach can also be applied at different scales. For example, given some classification of your first sentence, what kind of second sentence should follow? Given a classification of your first chapter, what kind of second chapter should follow? Many other kinds of knowledge can be similarly broken down into correlation orders, at different scales. We can do this for music, paintings, interior decoration, computer programs, math theorems, and so on.
