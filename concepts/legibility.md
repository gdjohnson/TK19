# Seeing Like A State 

Much as we see with massaged maps in [[opticratics]] and [[degeneration#Degenerate play|degenerate play]]—for instance, the way crimes are categorized in various police departments alters the evaluation of departmental performance—the specific _mode_ of interpreting, categorizing, or operationalizing, when left up to adversarial players with a competitive stake in the measuring system's outcome, leads to manipulative and strategic interpretation, categorizing, or operationalizing:

> A good part of the politics of measurement sprang from what a contemporary economist might call the “stickiness” of feudal rents. Noble and clerical claimants often found it difficult to increase feudal dues directly; the levels set for various charges were the result of long struggle, and even a small increase above the customary level was viewed as a threatening breach of tradition. Adjusting the measure, however, represented a roundabout way of achieving the same end.
> 
> The local lord might, for example, lend grain to peasants in smaller baskets and insist on repayment in larger baskets. He might surreptitiously or even boldly enlarge the size of the grain sacks accepted for milling (a monopoly of the domain lord) and reduce the size of the sacks used for measuring out flour; he might also collect feudal dues in larger baskets and pay wages in kind in smaller baskets. While the formal custom governing feudal dues and wages would thus remain intact (requiring, for example, the same number of sacks of wheat from the harvest of a given holding), the actual transaction might increasingly favor the lord. The results of such fiddling were far from trivial. Kula estimates that the size of the bushel (boisseau) used to collect the main feudal rent (taille) increased by one-third between 1674 and 1716 as part of what was called the reaction feodale.

## My response to Slate Star Codex review

Central to the concept of legibility is the concept of [[complexity]]. To legibilize is much akin to _reductionism_ in the sense that is sometimes meant by a rather polysemous term—that is, the sense in which human analysts attempt to reduce a complex system to a model that is (usually by multiple orders of magnitude) far too low-dimensional to adequately describe said system.

> Enlightenment rationalists noticed that peasants were just cutting down whatever trees happened to grow in the forests, like a chump. They came up with a better idea: clear all the forests and replace them by planting identical copies of Norway spruce (the highest-lumber-yield-per-unit-time tree) in an evenly-spaced rectangular grid. Then you could just walk in with an axe one day and chop down like a zillion trees an hour and have more timber than you could possibly ever want.

> This went poorly. The impoverished ecosystem couldn’t support the game animals and medicinal herbs that sustained the surrounding peasant villages, and they suffered an economic collapse. The endless rows of identical trees were a perfect breeding ground for plant diseases and forest fires. And the complex ecological processes that sustained the soil stopped working, so after a generation the Norway spruces grew stunted and malnourished. Yet for some reason, everyone involved got promoted, and “scientific forestry” spread across Europe and the world.

Here, the rationalists have failed in two ways. First, they reduced the complex functionality and appropriation of the forest by local inhabitants—not just lumber but "medicinal herbs" and game—and then optimized purely for this single variable, resulting (in a Pareto-inevitable way) in costly but unrecognized tradeoffs. (Tradeoffs are _inevitable_, but they must be _identified_, if one wishes to choose the better side of the bargain.) Second, they have reduced the complex ecosystemic health of the forest, which is crucial for its long-term survival (and hence, lumber output), to only the crudest horticultural understanding, meanwhile prioritizing a mathematically simple model of lumber output (Cartesian grids and maximum single-unit production) at the cost of a much more complex model (of diversity, synergy, and emergent long-term production).

We see the same two failures, both of misunderstanding the holistic needs of the ostensible catered-to community, and of misunderstanding the complex function of the system in which they intervened, in city design:

> Natural organically-evolved cities tend to be densely-packed mixtures of dark alleys, tiny shops, and overcrowded streets. Modern scientific rationalists came up with a better idea: an evenly-spaced rectangular grid of identical giant Brutalist apartment buildings separated by wide boulevards, with everything separated into carefully-zoned districts. Yet for some reason, whenever these new rational cities were built, people hated them and did everything they could to move out into more organic suburbs. And again, for some reason the urban planners got promoted, became famous, and spread their destructive techniques around the world.

Notice too the [[opticratics|opticratic]] nature of these interventions: the designers are governed by, not the _reality_ of order—which is complex and mysterious, but nonetheless exists in these dynamic adaptive systems—but the _appearance_ of order—which at the time was understood as cleanliness, minimalism, straight lines, and Cartesian coordinates. Nevermind that the flourishing of superorganisms, or the ecosystems they inhabit, operate via their own deep physical laws—these laws are mysterious, and thus, unable to deal with them, interventionists must instead overwrite them, impose a new order which is on its surface apparently sensible, while in reality deeply unfit to support life. Thus, the Alexander calls the High Modernist outlook behind these interventions was "an aesthetic taste masquerading as a scientific philosophy" and a kind of "LARPing."

However, Scott sees High Modernists as "pawns" to a regime which wished to legibilize its constituents for the sake of the "command-and-control goals of the state": "And so we gradually transitioned from systems that were messy but full of fine-tuned hidden order, to ones that were barely-functional but really easy to tax."

Alexander brings up Jane Jacobs, and redeems his previous negative preception of her in an implicit [[torque epistemology]] frame:

> [James Scott] rehabilitates her as someone who was **responding to the very real excesses of High Modernism**. She was the first person who really said “Hey, maybe people like being in cute little neighborhoods”. Her complaint wasn’t really against privacy or order per se as it was against **extreme High Modernist perversions of those concepts** that people empirically hated.

Dan Luu:
> This issue of projects which are more legible getting more funding is an issue across organizations as well as within them. For example, my friend says that, back when GiveWell was mainly or only recommending charities that had simply quantifiable return, she basically couldn't get her friends who worked in other fields to put resources towards efforts that weren't endorsed by GiveWell. People who didn't know about her aid background would say things like "haven't you heard of GiveWell?" when she suggested putting resources towards any particular cause, project, or organization. I talked to a friend of mine who worked at GiveWell during that time period about this and, according to him, the reason GiveWell initially focused on charities that had easily quantifiable value wasn't that they thought those were the highest impact charities. Instead, it was because, as a young organization, they needed to be credible and it's easier to make a credible case for charities whose value is easily quantifiable.

# Indexicality

Much of imperialism and its attendant philosophy, [[interventionOnBehalf|intervention-on-behalf]], fails from a lack of understanding of _local differences_ and _[[indexicality]]_. Many such interventionists, having noted a strategy that works well in their own local context, attempt to port it into a new local context. This local context may be sociocultural or environmental-geographic. Problems result because the context within which the ported solution is _[[fit]]_—exists harmoniously, and achieves the desired goals of the whole system—has now changed, rendering the ported solution _unfit_. This is how we end up with bizarre "computer science" courses being taught in impoverished schools with no access to computers, or with farming techniques optimized for European soil exported to radically different environmental situations with little success.
