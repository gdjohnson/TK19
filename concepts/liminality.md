In Victor Turner’s _Liminal to Liminoid, in Play, Flow, and Ritual_, he distinguishes between what he terms the “liminal” and the “liminoid.” Liminality, originating with Arnold van Gennep as a phase of ritual, is adapted by Turner to describe a general state of in-betweenness in which participants move from one state or place to another. During liminal periods, normative elements of social structure and the individual identity within are temporarily inverted (or else dissolved). Liminoid phenomena, meanwhile, are those which share many of liminality’s qualities — are liminal-like— but which do not permanently or significantly alter participants’ state/-us. Liminoid phenomena Turner describes as play instead of work, something optional instead of mandatory, and which has post- instead of pre-industrial origins.
