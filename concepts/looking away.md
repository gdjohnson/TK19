Frans De Waal, interview with Tamler Sommers: "I always feel that facts that are inconvenient for certain theories should be faced straight-on rather than be neglected."

Looking away is functionally equivalent to learned helplessness.

The only way to diagnose a problem is to look at it closely. You use your senses. You use your nose to track down an odor and find its source. You suppress the disgust reaction, you suppress the “what if the answer isn’t what I want it to be.” Eventually you do something so many times you lose the uncertainty or fear or self-doubt (all the same thing) that stopped you in the first place. You build a toolkit of approaches that you can reuse and combine, figure out the best strategies or default protocols. But you can’t get there if you can’t look.

# Last Rationalist: Memento mori

> it's not surprising that the most consequential map territory errors are motivated by fear. As children we believed there were monsters under our bed, but more extraordinary was the belief we could banish them by hiding under a blanket. This is the fundamental essence of a map-territory error. We control our perceptions, not the variables those perceptions are nominally meant to track. This creates magical beliefs, where we think that controlling our perceptions (the map) alters the territory.

Here we see the promise of something [[surrogation]]-like (evidenced by fields like PCT): optimizations for perception diverge from optimizations for reality in connection to divergences between perception and reality.

> i wonder if learned helplessness can be seen as equivalent to refusing to look. the way to diagnose a problem is look at it closely, use your senses. You sniff out an odor, track down its source. you sup - press your disgust reaction, suppress the voice that wonders, “what if the answer isn’t what I want it to be.” Eventually you do this so many times you shed the uncertainty or fear or self-doubt (these are the same thing?) that held you back in the first place. you build a toolkit of approaches to reuse or combine, but you get there in the first place by not looking away.

# Lerner 2020: Topeka School

> Do you remember how two winters ago it turned out that I hadn’t bought our Florida tickets, how I only discovered the night before, when I tried to print our boarding passes, that I’d never actually purchased them? [...] Whenever the trip came up [in the months leading up to it], I experienced a mild dread, mild enough that I didn’t really have to account for it to myself—maybe I was anxious about something else; maybe it’s just that I hate flying; maybe thinking about the trip reminds me of how far away I am from you and the girls. Normally, like a good neurotic, I’d double-check the tickets on my computer several times in the weeks before the flights, just to reconfirm the times, that our seats were together, but this subtle dread, this knowledge that wasn’t knowledge, prevented me from searching my email for the tickets, so that it wasn’t until the night before the trip, when Dad suggested I check in, print the boarding passes, that I discovered—that I could no longer avoid discovering—that I’d never bought them. I can’t believe this, I kept exclaiming, as I searched my Gmail, but in fact I had known it on some level all along. But that’s not exactly it, or not only it: **I think I’d felt that as long as I avoided looking for the tickets, they would be there; it was only if I searched the archive that they’d disappear, as if the past were up until that point indeterminate, that I might outrun it.** Do you know what I mean?

# [[Jane Austen|Austen]]'s Emma

Suk-Young Chwe:

> Emma does not allow Mr. Knightley to simply make his statement; Emma [enviously] thinks he is talking about Harriet and asks him not to speak. But Emma crucially reconsiders, thinking that she must allow Mr. Knightley to confide in her: "cost her what it would, she would listen. She might assist his resolution, or reconcile him to it; she might give just praise to Harriet, or, by representing to him his own independence, relieve him from that state of indecision." She tells Mr. Knightley that she will continue walking with him and that he should speak openly to her as a friend.

This decision results in Mr. Knightley disclosing his feelings for Emma.
