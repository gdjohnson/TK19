# Testosterone

## Eisenegger, Haushofer, Fehr 2011: The role of testosterone in social interaction

> the role of testosterone in social interaction in humans might be best conceptualized as bringing motives for seeking social status to the fore

It is possible that part of the relevant mechanism is as a conditioning reward system for status-gaining behavior; the authors note provocatively that "patients who are hypogonadal (testosterone levels too low) show apathy and lack of motviation, whereas testosterone administration in healthy subjects induces motivation to act."

**Challenge Hypothesis**: T levels rise only "in response to challenges (e.g. during the mating season)," perhaps to mitigate costly health effects of high T

> testosterone levels rise within minutes in anticipation of both physical and non-physical competition; for example, dyadic food competition in chimpanzees, or tennis, [[chess]] or domino tournaments in humans

> winners of [[sports|soccer]] matches show higher testosterone levels than do the losers

Men with heightened testosterone levels are more likely to be vigilant about status threats, and to perform high-status behavior (maintaining gaze, body language). They experience less fear and anxiety, and are more resistant to stress. They are more quick to meet anger with anger, to find someone untrustworthy, and display facial mimicry (or "mirroring") than usual.

> it has recently been shown that a single administratino of testosterone to young females leads to a significant impairment in the ability to infer emotions, intentions and feelings from the eye region of the face

> Several studies have shown that testosterone administration reduces anxiety-like behavior in rodents in several behavioral paradigms. [... and] to reduce subconscious fear and fear-potentiated startle.

> The [anxiolytic] effects are likely to be mediated via a non-genomic pathway and dependent on GABA~A~ receptor signaling.

It has not been shown, however—contrary to folk wisdom—"cause asocial, egoistic, or even aggressive behaviors in humans."
