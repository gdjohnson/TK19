_An entry for the on-going debate on rationality in the work of Klein, Gigerenzer, Tversky, Kahnemann._

DC Barker: 

> Bias is tautological. It says 'this person likes this thing because this person has a higher tendency to like this thing because they are this kind of person to like this thing because...' Bias does not touch internal motivations, what structures or generates the bias, etc. In other words, bias is a symptom that impels us to search for its origin or cause, not a cause or origin for anything. Now we're back in psychoanalytic territory.

Gopnik terms the "rational unconscious" the idea that the unconscious is not some great "roiling, passionate id, barely held in check by conscious reason and reflection," but rather that it is the origin of our most significant computational powers, that it is potentially Bayesian approximate and well-honed.

# Gary Klein 2011: Insight

> We know from the literature that people sometimes make mistakes. A lot of organizations are worried about mistakes, and try to cut down on errors by introducing checklists, introducing procedures, and those are extremely valuable. I don't want to fly in an airplane with pilots who have forgot their checklists, and don't have any ways of going through formal procedures for getting the planes started, and handling malfunctions, standard malfunctions. Those procedures are extremely valuable, and I don't doubt any of that. The issue is how does that blend in with expertise? How do people make the tradeoffs when they start to become experts? And does it have to be one or the other? Do people either have to just follow procedures, or do they have to abandon all procedures and use their knowledge and their intuition? I'm asking whether it has to be a duality. I'm hoping that it doesn't and this gets us into the work on system one and system two thinking.

> System two is a way of monitoring things, and we need both of those, and we need to blend them, and so it bothers me to see controversies about which is the right one, or are people fundamentally irrational, and therefore they can't be trusted? Obviously system one is marvelous. Danny Kahneman has put it this way, "system one is marvelous, intuition is marvelous but flawed." And system two isn't the replacement for our intuition and for our experience, it's a way of making sure we don't get ourselves in trouble.

> too many organizations that I study try to encourage people to just follow procedures, just follow the steps, and to be afraid to make any mistakes. The result is that they stamp out insights in their organization. They stamp out development of expertise in their organization, and they actually reduce the effectiveness and the performance of the organizations.

On the [[predictive processing|predictive]] element of intuition, and how individuals quick "read" a scene, matching its cues against their schematized experience:

> That became part of our modelâ€”the question of how people with experience build up a repertoire of patterns so that they can immediately identify, classify, and categorize situations, and have a rapid impulse about what to do. Not just what to do, but they're framing the situation, and their frame is telling them what are the important cues. That's why they're always looking, or usually looking, in the right place. They know what to ignore, and what they have to watch carefully.  

> It's also telling them what to expect, and by the way, when they think about what to expect, that gives them another advantage, because if their expectancy is violated, that's an indication, "Maybe I sized it up wrong. Maybe my situation awareness is wrong, maybe the way I've made sense of it is leading me in a wrong direction, I framed it in the wrong way, and I've got to rethink it."  

> We saw many examples where they would be surprised because their expectancy would be violated, and that would stop them in their tracks. That's the importance of a [[framing|frame]]; it gives you expectancies so that you can be surprised. The frame is also telling them what's the reasonable course of action.  

> Intuition is about expertise and tacit knowledge. I'll contrast tacit knowledge with explicit knowledge. Explicit knowledge is knowledge of factual material. I can tell people facts, I can tell them over the phone, and they'll know things. I can say I was born in the Bronx, and now you know where I was born. That's an example of explicit knowledge, it's factual information. But there are other forms of knowledge. There's knowledge about routines. Routines you can think of as a set of steps. But there's also tacit knowledge, and expertise about when to start each step, and when it's finished, when you're done and ready to start the next one, and whether the steps are working or not. So even for routines, some expertise is needed.

# Klein: Sources of Power

> Beth found that one of the difficult decisions the nurses had to make was to judge when a baby was developing a septic condition-in other words, an infection. These infants weighed only a few pounds-some of them, the microbabies, less than two pounds. When babies this small develop an infection, it can spread through their entire body and kill them before the antibiotics can stop it. Noticing the sepsis as quickly as possible is vital. 

> Somehow the nurses in the NICU could do this. They could look at a baby, even a microbaby, and tell the physician when it was time to start the antibiotic (Crandall and Getchell-Reiter 1993). Sometimes the hospital would do tests, and they would come back negative. Nevertheless, the baby went on antibiotics, and usually the next day the test would come back positive.

> The nurses could recall incidents, and in each case they could remember the details of what had caught their attention. The [[metonyms|cues]] varied from one case to the next... If a microbaby cried every time it was lifted up to be weighed and then one day it did not cry, that would be a danger signal to the experienced nurse. Moreover, the nurses were not relying on any single cue. They often reacted to a pattern of cues, each one subtle, that together signaled an infant in distress.
