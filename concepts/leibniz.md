## Predication and the universal subject

Leibniz sees the entire world as contained within each individual subject, bound up in a "universal subject," the ongoing event that is the universe.

> Every true proposition must be analytical, that is, such that it attributes something to a subject and that the attribute must be contained in the notion of the subject.

> In “Adam sinned,” sin at a particular moment belongs to the notion of Adam. Crossing the Rubicon belongs to the notion of Caesar. I would say that there, Leibniz proposes one of his first great concepts, the concept of inherence. Everything that is said with truth about something is inherent to the notion of this something.

> If you say that a particular event is encompassed in the notion of Caesar, “crossing the Rubicon” is encompassed in the notion of Caesar. You can’t stop yourself in which sense? From cause to cause and effect to effect, it’s at that moment the totality of the world that must be encompassed in the notion of a particular subject. That becomes very odd, there’s the world passing by inside each subject, or each notion of subject. In fact, crossing the Rubicon has a cause; this cause itself has multiple causes, from cause to cause, into cause from cause and into cause from cause from cause. It’s the whole series of the world that passes there, at least the antecedent series. And moreover, crossing the Rubicon has effects. If I limit myself to the largest ones, [there’s] the commencement of a Roman empire. The Roman Empire in its turn has effects, we follow directly from the Roman Empire. From cause to cause and effect to effect, you cannot say a particular event is encompassed in the notion of a particular subject without saying that, henceforth, the entire world is encompassed in the notion of a particular subject.

> if each individual notion, if each notion of the subject expresses the totality of the world, that means that there is only a single subject, a universal subject, and the you, me, Caesar, would only be appearances of this universal subject. It would be quite possible to say: there would be a single subject that would express the world.

## Determinism

Since the universal subject, the ongoing event that is the universe, flows through each individual subject, a deterministic logic is necessitated, and time, to some extent, loses meaning; could happen "no other way":

> Caesar crossed the Rubicon in a particular year, but whether he crosses the Rubicon in a particular year, it was encompassed for all time in his individual notion.

> Thus, crossing the Rubicon as event only acts to unroll something that was encompassed eternally in the notion of Caesar.

While, on an individual level, it may seem "possible" for Adam not to have sinned, or Caesar not to have crossed the Rubicon, given _everything else_ there was only ever one possibility; to not sin would be "incompossible":

> On the level of existences, it is not enough for a thing to be possible in order to exist, one must also know with what it is compossible. So Adam non-sinner is possible in himself, is incompossible with the world that exists. Adam could have not sinned, yes, but provided that there was another world. You see that [with] the inclusion of the world in the individual notion, and the fact that something else is possible, he reconciles suddenly the notion of compossibility, Adam non-sinner belongs to another world. Adam non-sinner could have been possible, but this world was not chosen. It is incompossible with the existing world. It is only incompossible with other possible worlds that have not passed into existence.

## Identity as perspective

As we are all a part of the ongoing event, the universal subject, we can as individual subjects only be defined by our perspective on the universal:

> Each one, each subject, for each individual notion, each notion of subject has to encompass this totality of the world, has to express this total world, but from a certain point of view, and there begins a philosophy that we have to call by its name, “perspectivism”. And it’s not inconsiderable. You will tell me: what is more banal than the expression “a point of view”?

> To create a theory of point of view, what does that imply? Could that be done at any time at all? Is it by chance that it’s Leibniz who created the first great theory at a particular moment? At the moment in which the same Leibniz created a particularly fruitful geometry chapter, called projective geometry. Is it by chance that it’s out of an era in which are elaborated, in architecture as in painting, all sorts of techniques of perspective?  We retain simply these two domains that symbolize with that: architecture-painting and perspective in painting on one hand, and on the other hand, projective geometry. Understand what Leibniz wants to achieve with them. He is going to say that each individual notion expresses the totality of the world, yes, but from a certain point of view.

> At the basis of each individual notion, there has to be a point of view that defines the individual notion. If you prefer, the subject is second in relation to the point of view.

> [Leibniz] established a philosophy that will find its name in the works of another philosopher who stretches out his hand to Leibniz across the centuries, specifically [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]. [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] will say: my philosophy is a perspectivism. You understand that it becomes idiotic or banal to die whining about whether perspectivism consists in saying that everything is relative to the subject. [...] what makes me equal me is a point of view on the world. [...] The individual notion is the point of view under which the individual expresses the world.

This point of view is somewhere between a [[Markov blankets|Markov blanket]] and a mental schema, one's immediate "zone" of observation and action, as well as one's ability to describe and interact with the world at a certain level or vantage point. 

> What defines my point of view is like a kind of projector that, in the buzz of the obscure and confused world, keeps a limited zone of clear and distinct expression. However stupid you might be, however insignificant we all may be, we have our own little thing, even the pure vermin has its little world: it does not express much clearly and distinctly, but it has its little portion. Beckett’s characters are individuals: everything is confused, an uproar [rumeurs], they understand nothing, they are in tatters [loques]; there is the great uproar [rumeur] of the world. However pathetic they may be in their garbage can, they have their very own little zone. What the great Molloy calls “my properties.” He no longer moves, he has his little hook and, in a strip of one meter, with his hook, he grabs things, his properties. It’s a clear and distinct zone that he expresses. We are all the same. But our zone has a greater or lesser size, and even then it’s not certain, but it is never the same.

> Leibniz has a metaphor that he likes: you are near the sea and you listen to waves. You listen to the sea and you hear the sound of a wave. I hear the sound of a wave, that is, I have an aperception: I distinguish a wave. And Leibniz says: you would not hear the wave if you did not have a tiny unconscious perception of the sound of each drop of water that slides one top and through each other, and make up the object of tiny perceptions. There is the roaring [rumeur] of all the drops of water, and you have your little zone of clarity, you clearly and distinctly grasp one partial result from this infinity of drops, from this infinity of roaring, and from it, you make your own little world, your own property.

> I express the totality of the world, but I only express clearly and distinctly a reduced portion of it, a finite portion.

To be able to perceive is continuous with the ability to act.
