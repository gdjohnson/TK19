# Intent

Tomasello’s _Origins of Human Communication_ claims our primary communicative motives are: requesting, informing, and sharing emotions/attitudes.

# Joint attention and common reference

Gross 2010, review of Tomasello’s _Origins of Human Communication_: 

> human communication... even from an early age, exploits our capacities for establishing joint attention, joint goals, and conceptual common ground.

Perry 2015, “Meaning and Pointing”: 

> Goodwin refers to the “hierarchy of displays being performed by the body” of the pointer: not only the “dual point” (at the map and then at the feature, with trowel and head, respectively), but also picking up the map and gazing at it in the first place, indicating a “domain of scrutiny” (the map) with his postural orientation as well as a target (the feature on the map) within the domain

# [[Kenneth Liberman|Liberman]]: Communicating Meanings

> Words and texts do not possess their meanings unequivocally in themselves. Instead, an occasioned discourse taken as a whole carries the sense, or rather is made to carry the sense, by serving as the vehicle for the discussants' worldly work of communicating meanings. The sense that is emerging guides the distribution of the meanings to each of the components of the discourse. These meanings are necessarily equivocal since the sense of the discourse is always emerging. "Meaning" has to be something about the words, but one cannot find it in the words alone. The words institute a shifting system of signification, but they themselves are subject to the very matrix they establish, which provides for them new traces of possible sense they can pick up.

> Linguistic interaction is an objective event. It is basic to the notion of "semiotic" that the signifying work inheres in the syntagmata and not in the predicative [[intent|intentions]] of the individual speaker. It is not that people are without [[agency]]; rather, agency becomes efficacious only when it is addressed to the field of significative possibilities provided by an emerging public matrix.

> It overstates the situation even to assert the participants' [[intent|intentions]] are "mediated" by the public matrix of meaning-making resources, since it is much more the case that they are led to their intentions by the semiotic structures in the first place; and it is not necessarily the case that participants always have an intention. Voluntarism is rarely to be seen, despite the favored place it has in North European and North American folk mythology; rather, the social matrix, to which participants are oriented, is steering the event... People live and speak in social contexts, which involve processes of mutual confirmation and thereby social obligations. As Adorno has suggested, here mimesis is as vital as conceptual rationality.

> the play of the syntagmata helps to provide the very context that resolves their own signification. The hearer must _remain open_ to both possibilities (and to any third, yet unconsidered possibility that may present itself). Further, it may be necessary for this openness to be sustained through some ensuing explanatory talk, _which can transform the preceding syntagmata_. [...] A verbal chain does not unidirectionally produce meaning; rather, the consequences prompt members of the speech community to interrogate the chain in light of the sense they grasp. In this way, the _unites significatives_ are clarified reflexively, by the very context they help establish.

> Though signs do not bear positive essences, the language system exploits co-arisen and interdependent signifying possibilities... As Ricoueur contends, "Ambiguity or equivocity appears to be the permanent counterpart of polysemy, or so to speak the price to pay for a polysemic language," but even this account retains a bias toward a static view of language that needs to be abandoned... The indeterminacy or instability of meaning is not a defect, to be rmedied by formal analytic fiat, but a vital resource for understanding and communicating.

> For at least two decades, linguistic research has proceeded by means of protocols administered on computer consoles, a method that offers no scope for witnessing the free serendipity of the work of collaborative listening and one that structurally fails to capture the social context of the event of conversing. And this is so even when the research is given the label "sociolinguistics."

# Performativity

Utterances which do not just describe but actually intervene on (create, transform, destroy) social realities.

## [[J.L. Austin]] 1962: How To Do Things With Words

> It was for too long the assumption of philosophers that the business of a "statement" can only be to "describe" some state of affairs, or to "state some fact," which it must do either truly or falsely.

Performatives require 1) a [[ritual]] opportunity—a pre-existing, "conventional" structure of meaning, or procedure, 2) an actor in whom the power to invoke the ritual procedure is vested, within a larger social context. In order to not be "void" they must further be executed 3) correctly and 4) completely. Lastly, there is often some "follow-through" expected, or there is some representation of internality that should be "sincere" for the performative to be "felicitous." 

"Misfires" are [[ritual|rituals]] which are improperly invoked in some way (the speaker lacks the power or context to invoke it, or has invoked it partially or improperly). "Abuses" are rituals whose implicit bindings and commitments are not followed-through.

## [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] 1969: Strategic Interaction

"[O]nce social agencies are introduced as enforcers, it is relatively easy to support spoken statements as moves." That is, in institutional [[concepts/games]], "specialized ready agencies can be called upon to give weight to words." For instance, in bridge, "the word 'double' [...] constitutes a commitment as real and intractable as laying down the ace of clubs." 

This is the realm of performative utterances such as swearings-in and "I do"—"the enforcement machinery is such as to give these verbal acts the effects of real moves."

# Neurath's Boat

>  We are like sailors who on the open sea must reconstruct their ship but are never able to start afresh from the bottom. Where a beam is taken away a new one must at once be put there, and for this the rest of the ship is used as support. In this way, by using the old beams and driftwood the ship can be shaped entirely anew, but only by gradual reconstruction.
