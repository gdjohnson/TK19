# Intent

Tomasello’s _Origins of Human Communication_ claims our primary communicative motives are: requesting, informing, and sharing emotions/attitudes.

# Joint attention and common reference

Gross 2010, review of Tomasello’s _Origins of Human Communication_: 

> human communication... even from an early age, exploits our capacities for establishing joint attention, joint goals, and conceptual common ground.

Perry 2015, “Meaning and Pointing”: 

> Goodwin refers to the “hierarchy of displays being performed by the body” of the pointer: not only the “dual point” (at the map and then at the feature, with trowel and head, respectively), but also picking up the map and gazing at it in the first place, indicating a “domain of scrutiny” (the map) with his postural orientation as well as a target (the feature on the map) within the domain

# [[Kenneth Liberman|Liberman]]: Communicating Meanings

> Words and texts do not possess their meanings unequivocally in themselves. Instead, an occasioned discourse taken as a whole carries the sense, or rather is made to carry the sense, by serving as the vehicle for the discussants' worldly work of communicating meanings. The sense that is emerging guides the distribution of the meanings to each of the components of the discourse. These meanings are necessarily equivocal since the sense of the discourse is always emerging. "Meaning" has to be something about the words, but one cannot find it in the words alone. The words institute a shifting system of signification, but they themselves are subject to the very matrix they establish, which provides for them new traces of possible sense they can pick up.

> Linguistic interaction is an objective event. It is basic to the notion of "semiotic" that the signifying work inheres in the syntagmata and not in the predicative [[intent|intentions]] of the individual speaker. It is not that people are without [[agency]]; rather, agency becomes efficacious only when it is addressed to the field of significative possibilities provided by an emerging public matrix.

> It overstates the situation even to assert the participants' [[intent|intentions]] are "mediated" by the public matrix of meaning-making resources, since it is much more the case that they are led to their intentions by the semiotic structures in the first place; and it is not necessarily the case that participants always have an intention. Voluntarism is rarely to be seen, despite the favored place it has in North European and North American folk mythology; rather, the social matrix, to which participants are oriented, is steering the event... People live and speak in social contexts, which involve processes of mutual confirmation and thereby social obligations. As Adorno has suggested, here mimesis is as vital as conceptual rationality.

> the play of the syntagmata helps to provide the very context that resolves their own signification. The hearer must _remain open_ to both possibilities (and to any third, yet unconsidered possibility that may present itself). Further, it may be necessary for this openness to be sustained through some ensuing explanatory talk, _which can transform the preceding syntagmata_. [...] A verbal chain does not unidirectionally produce meaning; rather, the consequences prompt members of the speech community to interrogate the chain in light of the sense they grasp. In this way, the _unites significatives_ are clarified reflexively, by the very context they help establish.

> Though signs do not bear positive essences, the language system exploits co-arisen and interdependent signifying possibilities... As Ricoueur contends, "Ambiguity or equivocity appears to be the permanent counterpart of polysemy, or so to speak the price to pay for a polysemic language," but even this account retains a bias toward a static view of language that needs to be abandoned... The indeterminacy or instability of meaning is not a defect, to be rmedied by formal analytic fiat, but a vital resource for understanding and communicating.

> For at least two decades, linguistic research has proceeded by means of protocols administered on computer consoles, a method that offers no scope for witnessing the free serendipity of the work of collaborative listening and one that structurally fails to capture the social context of the event of conversing. And this is so even when the research is given the label "sociolinguistics."

# Performativity

Utterances which do not just describe but actually intervene on (create, transform, destroy) social realities.

## [[J.L. Austin]] 1962: How To Do Things With Words

> It was for too long the assumption of philosophers that the business of a "statement" can only be to "describe" some state of affairs, or to "state some fact," which it must do either truly or falsely.

Performatives require 1) a [[ritual]] opportunity—a pre-existing, "conventional" structure of meaning, or procedure, 2) an actor in whom the power to invoke the ritual procedure is vested, within a larger social context. In order to not be "void" they must further be executed 3) correctly and 4) completely. Lastly, there is often some "follow-through" expected, or there is some representation of internality that should be "sincere" for the performative to be "felicitous." 

"Misfires" are [[ritual|rituals]] which are improperly invoked in some way (the speaker lacks the power or context to invoke it, or has invoked it partially or improperly). "Abuses" are rituals whose implicit bindings and commitments are not followed-through.

## [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] 1969: Strategic Interaction

"[O]nce social agencies are introduced as enforcers, it is relatively easy to support spoken statements as moves." That is, in institutional [[concepts/games]], "specialized ready agencies can be called upon to give weight to words." For instance, in bridge, "the word 'double' [...] constitutes a commitment as real and intractable as laying down the ace of clubs." 

This is the realm of performative utterances such as swearings-in and "I do"—"the enforcement machinery is such as to give these verbal acts the effects of real moves."

# Neurath's Boat

>  We are like sailors who on the open sea must reconstruct their ship but are never able to start afresh from the bottom. Where a beam is taken away a new one must at once be put there, and for this the rest of the ship is used as support. In this way, by using the old beams and driftwood the ship can be shaped entirely anew, but only by gradual reconstruction.

# Nebulosity

# Chapman: The Eggplant

> “Fruits are tasty.” Do you believe that, or not? It’s pretty clearly neither true nor false, so maybe it’s meaningless, as logical positivism recommended? It does seem to have some tenuous meaning… The problem is not so much that it’s meaningless as that it’s extremely indefinite. Which things count as “fruits”? Do you mean to include eggplants—technically berries—as fruits? Does “tasty” mean “tastes good” or “has some taste, not none?” (Is anything absolutely tasteless?) Tastes good according to whose liking? Does “are” imply “every single one,” or “generally speaking, but with some exceptions”?

> This is an extreme case, but all ordinary statements about eggplant-sized phenomena are also indefinite to some degree. What even counts as an eggplant? How about the various species of technically-eggplants that look and taste nothing like what you think of as one?1 Is a diced eggplant cooked with ground beef and tomato sauce still an eggplant? At exactly what point does a rotting eggplant cease to be an eggplant, and turn into “mush,” a different sort of thing? Are the inedible green sepals that are usually attached to the purple part of an eggplant in a supermarket—the “end cap,” we might say—also part of the eggplant? Where does an unpicked eggplant begin, and the eggplant bush it grows from end?

"Eggplant," then, is a term that covers millions of possible cases, and humans must use personal discretion and contextual inferences to determine the real subject of an eggplant-related utterance.

Attempts to make classifications and language more tractable, in a rationalist or positivist sense, typically involve some Carnapian explication of senses (e.g. fruit in the botanical sense, fruit in the culinary sense...) and an attempt to "hammer down" these senses of meaning into something non-nebulous. Such attempts run into several problems:

1. You typically discover a never-ending variety of weird exceptions, complications, and borderline cases. Is a glass bottle of poppy seeds “seed-bearing”? What is not a “structure”? Is a seedless banana a fruit? Is an eggplant still “part of an angiosperm” after it has been picked? (Does an entire object count as part of itself?) And what about the problems already encountered with cooked eggplants, rotting ones, and so forth?
2. The attempt often bogs down in taxonomizing an unbounded proliferation of “different senses,” which—as you repeatedly split them to deal with special cases—come to seem increasingly contrived, convoluted, and ad hoc. Dictionaries I consulted gave dozens of different definitions of “fruit,” with complicated relationships among them, all of them problematic in some way. “The developed ovary of a seed plant with its contents and accessory parts”: how developed does it have to be to count as a fruit? Which parts count as “accessories”? And “fruit” is quite well-behaved, as words go. The Oxford English Dictionary distinguishes 645 senses of “run.”
3. You find yourself trying to make one nebulous category (“fruit”) precise in terms of several others (such as “part”), which also turn out to be nebulous. Then you need to define those. You might think that eventually this process would terminate, that you would have covered the space of categories, that it would ground out in something solid; but in practice this never happens. The set of terms proliferates exponentially, and apparently endlessly.

The lessons, to Chapman, are a few—first, that absolute definitions are impossible _but unnecessary_: "We would need perfect clarity only if we needed absolute truth, but we don’t." 

> The function of language is not to express absolute truths. Usually, it is to get practical work done in a particular context. Statements are interpreted in specific situations, relative to specific purposes. Rather than trying to specify the exact boundaries of all the variants of a category for all time, we deal with particular cases as they come up. We use resources available in the context to make good-enough distinctions for action.

This view of language is fundamentally functional and therefore [[pragmatism|pragmatic]]. Echoing [[William James]], Chapman writes:

> Categorization serves practical purposes, so the underlying issue is not “is this absolutely and objectively an eggplant” but “can I make a decent moussaka from it?” Whether something counts as an eggplant [or rotted mush] (if it’s been in the refrigerator rather a long time) may depend on how badly you want moussaka. This is a main reason attempts at objective definition fail.

> This also explains the explosion of definitional “senses” [in attempts at explication]: they are attempts to specify in advance, in full generality, what will count as a member of the category in different contexts and for different purposes. Contexts and purposes are unenumerable, so this is impossible. In fact, we’ll see later that almost any word can mean almost anything, in some unusual context. This implies that analyzing words as having some enumerable set of “senses” can’t work.

Second, that the problem lies not merely in our map but in the territory, which is ontologically nebulous:

> We want terms to “carve nature at its joints,” but the eggplant-sized world has no joints. There is no natural, intrinsic, absolute distinction between eggplants and non-eggplants; nor can any specialized or technical subdivision of the category fully fix that.

The "true state" of the world is a collection of particle attributes; everything else is "rounding up," aggregation, and metaphor. There are no such things as "natural kinds":

> In philosophy, categories in the world that are absolute, intrinsic, or objective are called “natural kinds.” Pretty much the only available examples of natural kinds of eggplant-sized objects were biological species. Philosophers have reluctantly more-or-less accepted the recent factual discovery that species are necessarily nebulous, and that this makes the “natural kind” concept obsolete. 

In this frame, Plato's conceptual ideal (cutting nature at its joints) is impossible; nature doesn't _have_ joints. Formal logic requires ontological definiteness, but the ontology of the world is _indefinite_, nebulous:

> Earlier I asked “What sort of world would rationalism be true of?” It would be made of ontologically definite objects, categories, properties, and relationships. [...] There is a truth about which ontologically definite object something is, so either two are the same one, or different ones. There is a truth about whether some bit of matter is part of a definite object, or not. A definite object either is, or is not, a member of a definite category. An ontologically definite object has definite properties. They could be absolute (“is red”) or parameterized (“is 72% red”). What they can’t be is vague (“well, reddish I suppose”). Definite objects either do, or do not, stand in definite relationships with each other. The cat is on the mat, or it’s not.

## Ontological remodeling as a solution to nebulosity

> Ontological remodeling—the reconfiguration of individuation criteria, categories, properties, and relationships

> There are various typical patterns for ontological change... One of the simplest and most common is replacing a binary opposition with a continuum.

Our categories are nebulous in the sense of being unified only by "family resemblance" ([[Wittgenstein]]), where there "is no single common feature, it’s just that this is similar to that, which is similar to another thing."

Chapman's factoring of "meta-rationality," and its treatment of categories (and the concept of truth) look basically [[pragmatism|pragmatic]]:

> Meta-rationality treats all categories as inherently purpose-laden—including scientific categories. It rejects the rationalist ideal of perfectly disinterested Truth.

> Once you recognize that denial of nebulosity is the deep structure underlying each of the difficulties rationalism encounters, the solution approach is obvious: accept nebulosity from the beginning, and work with it, instead of trying to ignore or eliminate it.

Meta-rationality attempts to synthesize formal systems rationality with sensibleness or "reasonableness":

> Reasonableness is not interested in universality. It aims to get practical work done in specific situations. Precise definitions and absolute truths are rarely necessary or helpful for that. Is this thing an eggplant? Depends on what you are trying to do with it. Is there water in the refrigerator? Well, what do you want it for? What counts as baldness, fruit, red, or water depends on your purposes, and on all sorts of details of the situation.

Like Sarah, he argues for a maintenance of _grounding_, or "correspondence":

> Sometimes a system can be made to work better by improving concrete practices for maintaining correspondences.

### Examples

#### Concepts that have been abandoned entirely

> categories like phlogiston, the luminiferous aether, and the Philosopher’s Stone turned out to have nothing in them, and got dropped. The taxon “Bestiae,” the Great Chain of Being, and the Hippocratic humors turned out to group genuine entities in useless ways, and so were also dropped.

#### Concepts which have been abandoned formally, but retain usefulness informally

> fire was an ontologically basic, formal category for thousands of years. After the Chemical Revolution of the 1700s, it dropped out of official scientific theory. It’s an ill-formed category, because there are too many marginal cases. Informally, it describes redox reactions within a nebulous range of rates and temperatures, in which the oxidizer is typically but not necessarily oxygen. An explosion is a too-fast redox reaction; rusting is too slow to count; fuel cell reactions run too cold. Burning sugar with sodium chlorate as the oxidizer sure looks like a fire, but should it count? On the other hand, although “fire” is no longer a formal category, the Chemical Revolution made it possible to understand combustion in general, and particular redox reactions, vastly better than before.

> “Species” was an ontologically basic, formal category in biology for thousands of years. Over the past few decades, better understanding of population dynamics has shown that it’s unavoidably nebulous. In general, there is no fact-of-the-matter about whether or not two individuals belong to the same species. However, as a consequence of that same remodeling, we understand speciation processes far better than when the category was taken to be well-defined.

> In 2006, the category “planet” disintegrated into absurdity. It got a new, official definition, which most everyone loathes and ignores. Discovery of numerous marginal cases made it clear that “planets” have nothing meaningfully in common. However, we understand individual planets far better than before. And, “planet” is still useful as a vague category in some contexts, so long as you realize there is no fact-of-the-matter about whether Pluto counts.

## Reference

Chapman performs an "ethnomethodological flip" on the question of reference, looking at the concrete ways human being perform and sustain reference:

> We have to do the job that the correspondence theory attributed to metaphysical fairies. Reference is a task that we achieve with concrete work over time in a specific situation for a specific purpose.

Rather than a tidy formal system, these techniques of achieving reference are messy, ranging from "ungainly, amateurish kludges" to more established metonymy. "Referring is accomplished by whatever means is available, and improvised methods are unenumerable."

Relevance is a huge part of reference, and relevance is usually instrumental to a task at hand:

> Referring is possible only because the specificity of our purposes limit relevance. We don’t go around referring to arbitrary sets of atoms or random regions of spacetime. In everyday activity, we only want to refer to something because it’s relevant to our purposes. The way in which it is relevant usually provides adequate resources for referring.

> Referring is always context-dependent. This is a brute fact of physics. There is no absolute coordinate system, no (0, 0, 0) point to start from.
