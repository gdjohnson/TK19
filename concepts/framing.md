The framing of an activity determines the relevant [[genre|values hierarchies]] an evaluating agent puts in place.

Hazard 2021: [["Intuitionistic Type of Guy Theory"]]
> I was exposed to a new angle. Instead of presenting fitting into the social world as "doing what people want so they like you" (i.e. conforming), it presented the task as "playing human nature with finesse to lead to everyone thinking you're the best". Suddenly it was I who was getting one up on them! I wasn't bending to the whim of others, I was gaming the timeless truths of social reality! That small shift in frame completely reversed how everything felt.

aka "Conceptualization Rules Everything Around Me"

See also [[conceptual art]] entry, [[analogy]] entry (since much of framing, especially the framing of novel phenomena, works by analogy). 

The possible context for a writer's writing is his entire information state, and for a reader, hers, and in trying to understand collectively a writer practically everything and anything may be shown to be relevant, for instance the causal forces which may have shaped the writer's writing. 
Why such a vast tract? Well, because the workings of the world are tied up; anything _can_ be relevant depending on project, on _agenda_: anything that correlates with the writer and writing and circumstances and reader written to (etc etc), that is everything that is "information" to some aspect of the writer, writing (... etc etc). Anything that "makes its mark" makes its mark, _is_ in some way relevant insofar as the writing testifies to the maker of the mark, and the maker to the writing. (Most of this vast tract of relevance is shared by cultural members, and thus "disappeared.") And this is true even of makers whose mark is accomplished through several layers of causal influence. That is, IF there is a "white patriarchy," to ANY extent, then there is a valid white patriarchy lens to read any writing within said society with in such a way as to illuminate either/both the society and the text. 

However, interactants clearly shift between sets of interpretive emphasis, salience, finding some aspects more relevant as disambiguators but also inferentially. That shift in relevance corresponds to environmental expectancies and project-based modeling (both reader and writer's project). This fact calls for an [[rational speech act theory|RSA]] treatment of frames.

The sharing of schemas is like a two-way generator-discriminator relationship (where each party is a discriminator to the other's generator, and vice-versa). Each conversationalist syncs each other up to the same "script" or "frame" or "definition" or "model" of the interaction. 

There is a circularity whereby we take up a frame, pursue and possess certain ends as a result of that frame, and then use those ends as justification for the frame to begin with—when those ends are only valuable in the first place _within the frame_.

> Fortunately—for our sanity, the exploitative manipulation of framing conventions is both dangerous to practice and difficult to maintain. Dangerous because the manipulator is in a peculiarly vulnerable position. If his misframing is discovered in time, the intended victim can turn the tables on. ‘him simply by going along with the game, accepting his version of reality at face value. This is what people do when they go to land‐rush dinners to get the free meal. And difficult because in most cases as soon as the manipulator gets what he wants, the frame he attempted to establish is discredited. “The Sting” was so much fun because Newman's and Redford's misframing not only succeeded but was never exposed. Anyone who saw the movie, though, will have a reasonably good idea of how rare such durable misframings are. In most cases, the victim will retrospectively reframe the entire situation; in our night club example, that is, he not only will recognize that the evening ended up in a sale, but also will come to feel that it was a sales pitch "all along"

# Scheff 2006: Goffman Unbound
### Response/thoughts
#### On ACiM and categories as heuristics
1.  I thought I was having reading Tom Scheff on [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]]'s "frame" is that the [[all communication is manipulation|ACiM]]/categories as heuristics/microeconomics of communication stuff is trying to getting at defining what "context" actually is—that an utterance is like an organism, or like a design choice, in that it's shaped by/a response to context, "fit" being the key word; that when we say eg that utterances are shaped by historical discourses (as in eg torque stuff), or by personal history (eg between individuals), it's a bit like saying battlebots are shaped by the anti-inductive red queen evolving strategic "discourse"/"dialectic" of moves and countermoves, or a bit like saying the color of a butterfly is "scoped" contextually to the percentage of similar-colored butterflies that are poisonous (protected against predators)
2. It seems like there are frames in the sense of pragmatic ontologies for given domains (see also [[David Chapman]]'s "meaningful perception," technical jargon, etc), which can be intensely personal (e.g. a craftsman who develops a unique frame for his praxis over decades) or fundamentally social/cultural (shared noticing, shared direction of attention, shared models required by our ability to reference a "red box" or "coffee pot"). And then social frames are like... maybe a subset of this kind of frame? Specifically for the activity of interaction, and scoped to different "kinds" of interaction the way a blacksmith has different pragmatic ontologies for smelting different kinds of metal, or for different daily practices like swelting but also handling customers, training his apprentice, buying groceries
3. And the rough synchronization of models that is a prerequisite of communication (this is a @sameQCU idea, taken from [[Karl Friston]]) creates an emergent "social definition of a situation" the way Goffman's always going on about, almost as if it's an extrinsic thing that exists outside individuals, because that's what happens when interpretations/framings of a situation become common knowledge

#### What is context/frame?
Context is all information that might be, or is made to be, relevant to the initiation and reception of agent actions ("writings"/transformative deltas to the environment). 
--> There is no globally true "context" but rather, a writer context which shapes the creation of the utterance (which is something like his complete cognitive model at moment of utterance) and a reader context which shapes the interpretation of an utterance --> The reader, insofar as s/he's genuinely trying to understand an action, might privilege the writer context as the "true" context, but this is still instrumental to understanding the writer 
--> The writer, insofar as s/he's most effectively trying to affect a reader, might privilege the reader context as the "true" context, but this is still instrumental to communicating with the reader 

Context/frame & the live stream/"strip" of information have a cybernetic relation, similar to the Hermeneutic Circle, where interpretive context/frame influences interpretation of novel information, which influences/alters the frame/context, which influences the interpretation of the next part of the "strip" of experience... etc etc 
--> This context is a "compressive top" (in the top-down sense) interfacing with/organizing/making meaningful piecemeal bottom-up data. 
--> An idealized contextualist view of meaning is something like "the effects and fit between a part and every other part," but storing all these parts is too expensive, so we "diff" and sum them up into the synoptic or compressive "top" 

Frame synchronization means both partners mutually possess, & connect to the present activity, whatever contextual information is pragmatically relevant to deploying coordinated action 
--> Information/models are roughly synchronized to the extent that they need to be/are tested by actual actions—because these actions, and failures of coordination/synchronicity, provide the bottom-up feedback which alters the "compressive top" frame of participants

#### Cultural relativism
Cultural relativism—the idea that, within cultural systems/contexts, things we Westerners might find repellent or "irrational" are in fact very much rational/load-bearing, and we can only criticize norms within the larger cultural context—is the "extra-gamic perspective"—the view from nowhere, from outside games

(The relativism part is extra-gamic; the "rationality is very culturally contextual" bit is very much gamic/grounding itself in the games played)

# Reason 2016: Genres, Value Hierachies
> how an artwork is framed and conceptualized has a major impact on how it’s received

> There is no idea of absolute “success” or “effectiveness” for a piece of art: success requires criteria by which to be successful. Art is only effective at doing _something_, and whether or not a critic finds a work to be effective depends almost entirely on what he thinks it’s trying to do.

> it’s worth noting that in music criticism, it is currently conventional wisdom — religious dogma, even — that genres are bad for the industry and the art. Often there’s some argument about categories constraining innovation or stifling creativity. But I’d argue exactly the opposite is true — that [interesting, meaningful transgression and deviation _requires_ rules and categories](https://suspendedreason.wordpress.com/2016/05/14/chekhovs-gun-and-red-herrings-meaning-rules-and-transgression-in-storytelling/), and that without genre frameworks within which to work, artistic innovation would be, if not impossible, vastly harder to accomplish and vastly harder to identify (and thus extract value from). Moreover, genres and categories are necessary for critical judgment to take place in the first place. While the example earlier demonstrated personal disparities in hierarchies within a genre (the anti-experimental rock fan vs. the Radiohead-loving critic), each genre itself comes with its own set of critical and artistic priorities that are fairly common across in-group fans and critics. This allows community consensus about what’s allowed within the boundaries of the category, and moreover what the paragons of achievement with the category will be.

> Which reagent you employ will determine which color you get back. Apply a few drops of folk standards and the band's simple harmonic progressions, clichéd lyrics, and slightly autotuned lyrics yield a muddy black of failure and poor quality. Yet assess these characteristics with the pop reagent and suddenly they are all strength: the progressions are predictable and accessible, which [triggers dopamine releases among even first-time listeners](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/09/opinion/sunday/why-music-makes-our-brain-sing.html?_r=0) (ideal for radio play); the lyrics are not clichéd but universal, appealing to mass audience base of listeners in all age brackets; the vocal line stays on pitch in a sonically agreeable way. "Little Lion Man" is fantastically successful as a pop song. By folk or rock standards, it crumples: it is pretentious and vague, flawed from its very conception.

# TIS Transcript 210709

[12:33 PM] suspended reason: idea I had on the dock today: retroactive reconceptualization
[12:39 PM] suspended reason: It comes out of two things:
1. The realization that many things I've historically wanted to call "retconning" were not really attempts at retroactively continuity, so much as just any attempt to produce new speech/text/narrative that retroactively altered the original text.
2. A conversation about strategies when you accidentally send the wrong person a text (e.g. that's about them, or inappropriate for your relationship)—mine was "they don't know when you realized you were texting the wrong person; immediately send a second text that alters the meaning of the first, while still appearing to be an accidental message to the wrong recipient," so e.g. if you send your employee something about lingerie, you can chase it with an obvious spam link ("buy real ray-bans at tinyurl"), or if you shit-talk one friend to another friend (but send it to the first) you can chase it with something very complimentary, or that leverages ambiguities in your first text to put a different implied "spin" on it
[12:39 PM] suspended reason: I think people do this with text a lot
[12:40 PM] suspended reason: Maybe they make a commitment, or express a belief, or make a claim, and then a little later in conversation they may try to advance an alternative spin on that earlier text/speech by adding more speech to the first speech
[12:41 PM] suspended reason: Clumsy players do this explicitly—"Earlier, when I said X, I meant Y"—but skilled players do it implicitly, by adding information that a (clever listener) will pick up and use to retroactively update the meaning of a previous ambiguous utterance
[12:42 PM] suspended reason: To shift the "majority" interpretation (is there a word for this in like, probability/stats/Bayesian stuff? the event testified to most strongly by the evidence) of that previous text
[12:43 PM] suspended reason: Politicians do this constantly
[12:43 PM] suspended reason: People are forced to do this when old tweets come up that contradict present stances, or that are unflattering in a new political/cultural/moral landscape
[12:44 PM] suspended reason: And I think you even get it in television, or other serialized art—they want new affordances, and they can tell what possibilities have been "ruled out" by previous information, and which possibilities are still live/possible in the half-determinate structure of physics/reality/"rules of the game" they've constructed so far
