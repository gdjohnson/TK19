# Reason 2021: Notes on the Inexact Sciences
All knowledge is about the same thing, which is the workings of the world. And since the workings of the world are bound up in one another—with kinships that result from shared materials, shared dynamics, shared problems, shared ancestry—the knowledge from one subject can be brought to bear on many others. An institution, like a body, like the cells that make up bodies, must preserve its boundaries and maintain homeostasis, must allow information flows while protecting against intruders. The principles of mimicry, free-riding, and frequency-dependent selection that persevere in butterflies apply equally to bank fraud. The problems of plasticity, the tradeoff between structure and potential; explore-exploit algorithms and optimal stopping—these are eternal dynamics of complex, optimizing systems. Sometimes these parallels are dubbed _metaphor_, as one might call “[selection games](https://suspendedreason.com/2021/05/28/selection-games/)” a metaphor—but the line between metaphor and category is purely a conventional one: to say two objects or events are alike _just is_ to create a new category.

Our ongoing conversation about these workings occurs simultaneously at many levels of both systematic abstraction—particle, neuron, mind, society—and of precision or literalism. Much of discourse is impossibly vague and imprecise in carving its objects of inquiry or describing their behavior. When such fields attempt to be precise, and hammer out a tractable definition (of say “anger,” “causation,” or “etiquette”), they end up studying some other, new construct, that is neither anger nor etiquette. When such studies try experimentally to survey and graph the usage of these concepts, to capture their entirety, they become subject to the historical idiosyncrasies which have informed their society’s concepts of anger and etiquette—but then attempt to ground these historical constructs in neuroscience, hormones, MRI studies, regions of the brain, as if this construct were one-to-one with biological features. They go looking for “essences” but know not where to look; the abstract nouns they are theoretically interested in prove ever elusive. These “inexact science” fields, which have not yet reached the status of “prediction machines,” include psychology, anthropology, linguistics, economics, and sociology.

Still more “wild” and inexact are fields like art and literature themselves, which work at high levels of abstraction with the thrownness of life, mapping social patterns and psychological archetypes. Art and literary criticism are a gateway realm, discerning demonstrated structures in artistic creations; compressing and analyzing their patterns: Balzac’s observations on social relations, Dostoevsky’s on the mind, Kafka on institutions, Austen on sense and sensibility, Beckett on language. The use of Shakespeare (_Hamlet_) or Sophocles (_Oedipus_) in psychoanalytic theory is one example of this rigorizing pipeline; René Girard’s mimetic structure (inspired by works like _Don Quixote_) a second. Timur Kuran’s theory of preference falsification was first exemplified by Hans Christian Andersen’s “The Emperor’s New Clothes,” while Lewis Carroll’s writing birthed the red queen hypothesis and the map-territory distinction. (And this is to say nothing of literature’s enormous _verbal_ contribution to cognition—the extent to which many social, emotional, and psychological constructs we take for granted are recent coinages. How can one study what one cannot talk about?)

This rigorizing pipeline, from wilderness to structure, vagueness to precision, ends in the zone of “hard” exactitude, the realm of verification and falsifiability. Kevin Scharp describes the role of philosophy—itself on the “wild” end of the inexact sciences—in this rigorizing pipeline:

> For the past 400 years, philosophy has been shrinking. That is a sociological fact. Physics, geology, chemistry, economics, biology, anthropology, sociology, meteorology, psychology, linguistics, computer science, cognitive science—these subject matters were all part of philosophy in 1600. As the scientific revolution ground on, more and more sciences were born. This process is essentially philosophy outsourcing its subject matter as something new—sciences. The process is rather complicated, but the most important part of it is getting straight on the right concepts to use so that the subject matter can be brought under scientific methodology. Ultimately, the radical therapeutic program—showing the fly the way out of the fly bottle—is taking an active role in this outsourcing process. Identify conceptual defects (Socratic idea) and craft new concepts that avoid the old defects (Nietzschean idea) with an eye toward preparing that philosophical subject matter for outsourcing as a science. The ultimate goal of this process is the potential end of philosophy–escape for the fly.

This is the idea popular among rationalists that the goal of philosophy should be to kill itself: that philosophy _just is_ the study of the vague and unverifiable, and that its purpose is dealing with this vagueness _in order_ to demystify the subject domain. As a philosophical idea slowly formalizes itself into something truly testable, it has become no longer philosophy, no longer “inexact.” There are other kinds of philosophy of course—the therapeutic or “cope” sort perhaps best modeled by the Stoics and Epicureans, for instance; the “re-enchantment” philosophies of William James—but these are of a very different goal than naturalistic or metaphysical inquiries. (The realms of _ought_ instead of _is_.)

Some disciplines, ashamed by their identity as inexact sciences, embarrassed by living on “the wrong side of the tracks,” have tried to get ahead of themselves. Tempted by the prestige, authority, and grant money of science, they have tried to skip over stamp-collecting and case study, description and taxonomy, straight to statistics, hypothesis, and lab coat. These disciplines thus become [cargocults](https://calteches.library.caltech.edu/51/2/CargoCult.htm) of scientism, bordering on fraudulence. They resemble the state and sophistication of pre-modern medicine—all while profiting off the real predictive power and insight of the hard sciences through their nominal and institutional association. Hence the simultaneous [replication](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/11/psychologys-replication-crisis-real/576223/) and [generalizability crises](https://psyarxiv.com/jqw35/) in psychology.

> Verbally expressed psychological constructs—things like cognitive dissonance, language acquisition, and working memory capacity—cannot be directly measured with an acceptable level of objectivity and precision. What _can_ be measured objectively and precisely are operationalizations of those constructs—for example, a performance score on a particular digit span task, or the number of English words an infant has learned by age 3. Trading vague verbal assertions for concrete measures and manipulations is what enables researchers to draw precise, objective quantitative inferences; however, the same move also introduces new points of potential failure, because the validity of the original verbal assertion now depends not only on what happens to be true about the world itself, but also on the degree to which the chosen proxy measures successfully capture the constructs of interest—what psychometricians term construct validity.

And we all know what happens when we [operationalize](https://suspendedreason.com/2021/07/22/surrogation-overview/), when we erect surrogate idols.

Instead of staying at the level of “mere” description, these fields have been driven to a theater of science:

> D: The other day Micky you said psychology was all a bit of a show. A show! And you’re right! But what the fuck does that say about what we’re doing here?
> 
> M: It’s true, the experiments are just performance to the thinking. Sometimes I wonder if I’d be better off doing close description.
> 
> Conversation between psychologists psychologists Dave Pizarro, Michael Inzlicht, and Yoel Inbar, _Very Bad Wizards_.

And yet the sunk cost of time investment prevents even those researchers like Pizarro and Inzlicht—who _recognize_ the performative nature of their “objective” methodology—from meaningfully altering procedure or course:

> We’re doing a show? This isn’t real, but we’re pretending it’s real? That’s a damning thing to say, but nothing that came after followed from that [conclusion]… I don’t know what it would [even] look like to act on that belief in [the field of psychology].
