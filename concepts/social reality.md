[[Friedrich Nietzsche]], Truth & Lies in a Nonmoral Sense

> What then is truth? A movable host of metaphors, metonymies, and; anthropomorphisms: in short, a sum of human relations which have been poetically and rhetorically intensified, transferred, and embellished, and which, after long usage, seem to a people to be fixed, canonical, and binding... to be truthful means to employ the usual metaphors. Thus, to express it morally, this is the duty to lie according to a fixed convention, to lie with the herd and in a manner binding upon everyone.

Reality is frequently defined as "what doesn't go away when you stop believing in it." We'll define social reality as what _does_ go away—at least when the _group_ stops believing in it. An individual embedded inside a social reality may lose faith or suffer a deconversion event and yet feel as if the social reality is stronger than ever (as it has become newly "visible").

Social reality is group prediction error minimization—the shared sense of seeing that people synchronize one another to, which prevents too much unpleasant surprisal in interaction and, through shared context, allows communication.

Social reality is informed by self-reports, verbal claims, etc, and deception is both taboo and punished because it is, in this sense, a fabrication of reality, informing decision and action on false premises. César Aira, _Ghosts_ 2009:

> The worst thing is the way they lie, Felix Tello was saying... The architect's words met a most attentive reception. Such attentiveness is not unusual when the lies of a third party were at issue.

Schütz 1962:

> The observational field of the social scientist—social reality—has a specific meaning and relevance structure for the human beings living, acting, and thinking within it. By a series of common-sense constructs they have pre-selected and pre-interpreted this world which they experience as the reality of their daily life. It is these thought objects of theirs which determine their behavior by motivating it.

Let us imagine a sailor, washed up on a desert island with his captain, and all other souls lost. This sailor may "reify" the social reality, the social order he was previously under, and continue obeying his captain's orders _as inferior_. But it is more likely that, unless the captain has some enforcement mechanism, be it a pistol or some far-off threat of hanging (upon rescue), the pair's hierarchical relation will quickly fade to a more pragmatic one premised on mutual accord. 

What previously enforced the hierarchy, and made the captain's word law? Of course, the shared acknowledgment of his authority, such that, should any individual defect, other sailors, or the officer class, would quickly assist in the flogging. It is when the shared acknowledgment of an authority structure is disrupted, and the underclass lose confidence that their peers will work to enforce it, mutiny becomes viable.

This center of authority is a Schelling point for coordination which is protected by the difficulty of tacitly coordinating to a new [[Thomas Schelling|Schelling]] point (without being caught and punished). This example, while perfectly intuitive and merely re-traversing well-understood ground, shows in a simple way how social reality is created and maintained by a group's individuals, where assessment of the strength of the social reality reflexively strengthens or weakens it via its grasp on individuals' decisions.

"For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for nature cannot be fooled." (Richard Feynman, Challenger investigation)

# Rules

One [[game theory|game-theoretic]] insight is that rules work not by "banning" a behavior but by changing the cost-benefit analysis for an actor. But we must not forget that there is another level, the internalization and reification of social reality, such that the actor feels a sense of compulsion or pro-sociality, or else does not even realize that the banned behavior is a possible move, or else, finally, such as to play into an individual's general strategy of cooperation over time, a general strategy formed through the condensation of many defection costs and many general cooperative benefits, of reputation within a community over time. In other words, while the immediate "move" may be strategic in this macro-scale, more often the calculus of many prior dilemmas becomes a guiding principle of action that overrides the immediate calculus of the situation-at-hand.

# Perry (2015): Gardens Need Walls—On Boundaries, Ritual, and Beauty

> ...a huge portion of our internal cognitive machinery, of which we are not normally aware, is concerned with the ordinary functino of maintaining one's own identity and that of others.

> Each person’s self is spread out among many people, _simulated_ in all their brains at varying levels of granularity. And each person has a different “self” for each one of the people he knows, and a different self for every social context. A teenager has a very different way of behaving, speaking and thinking around his friends from the way he behaves, speaks, and thinks around his grandparents. The self at work is different from the self at home with close friends, or in bed with a spouse. And none of these are the “true self” – rather, the self exists in all these, and in the transitions between them. There can never be one single, public self; to collapse all these multiple selves together would be akin to social death.

# Mundia and Modia

> Modia: The world is made of relationships between people. We can successfully manipulate the world by figuring out who is powerful, or by becoming powerful ourselves. We must learn to be responsive to people in the right way, or to act in a way which will elicit the response we want. How we look, dress, how we express ourselves, and even the opinions that we hold, are all factors in interpersonal relationships. Since power relationships are always changing, this world, unlike Mundia, is continually shifting, and knowledge about the world quickly goes out of date. Intelligent Modians use their wits to develop an acute sensitivity to the Zeitgeist. They must know whether to support the powerful, in the hopes of being raised by association, or perhaps rebel in the hopes of joining (or starting) a new power center. They must know who, and what, is in or out, since a faux pas can lead to immediate loss of status. Finally, for the most part, the world of Modia, unlike Mundia, is a zero-sum-game: one person’s gain is another’s loss. Status relationships can never be win-win.

> All human institutions tend to become Modian over time, for the simple reason that they are made up of people. The more subjective the criteria for success, the more Modian the organization will become. Those institutions that have little or no exogenous criteria for success, like government, academia, or the non-profit sector, will inevitably come to be dominated by Modians, whatever their explicit goals may be. Businesses, which must make a profit to survive, are not immune to this tendency. Though they have exogenous criteria for success, it is a difficult task to propagate the objective criteria for success down through the ranks – at each level of decision making there will be some degree of subjectivity, and by the time we reach the bottom rank, decisions might be completely Modian.
