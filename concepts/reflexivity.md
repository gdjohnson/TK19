_Reflexive_ first appears in English in 1588 and is first used in its current meaning, as bending back upon itself, in 1640. The term describes the capacity of signification systems "to turn or bend back upon itself, to become an object to itself and to refer to itself" (Babcock 1980).

Reflexivity is related to Hegel's concept of self-consciousness, in his theory of dialectics. To be a self-sufficient and self-conscious, as opposed to merely conscious, one must actively reflect on one's script, rather than merely embody it habitually. Hegelian "recognition" stems from the desire to be recognized as a self-conscious, self-sufficient entity, and is achieved through self-negation, which is a kind of self-contradiction resulting from self-reflection.

Hofstadter's concept of "strange loops" is premised on a similar notion of reflexivity, what Hegel would call an "nth-level," continuous reflecting process.

In older thinkers like Locke, Spinoza, and Leibniz, "reflection" is in some ways equivalent to "reflexivity" as we currently understand it, the acting of the mind back on itself. In contrast to vain solipsism, Merleau-Ponty sees reflexivity as a way of getting away from the self, rather than returning to it; a way of "knowing how w eare grafted to the universal by that which is most our own."

> In his earlier work on [[ritual]] and ritual symbols, Victor Turner (1974) suggested that liminal periods are reflexive moments when society "takes cognizance of itself" and reflects on the order of things through symbolic disordering, through the "analysis and recombination of the factors of culture into any and every possible pattern" (p. 255). In later works (1979, 1982, 1984), Turner argued that all genres of cultural performance (ritual, myth, theater, narrative, games, etc.) are instances of plural reflexivity because they are self-critiques and reflections upon, rather than simply reflections of, the structures and strictures of the everyday world.

# Mutual modeling and reflexivity

_See also [[Intelligence as Futures Optimization]] and [[Theory of Mind]]._

There are a few reasons individuals' choices end up informing other individuals' choices. One approach is to cast this as simple imitation, social learning, or herding. The other is informationally rational—the reverse-engineering of knowledge from action, based in the assumption that the emulated individual has access to information, and experience, that the emulating individual does not possess. The adjustment is a perfectly defensible Bayesian update. Interestingly, the "herding" model, while cynical on the strategic benefits, may operate this same way. See Banerjee (1992) and Bikchandani, Hirschleifer, and Welch (1992) for this line of thought, which Matthew McKeever has compared to standpoint epistemology.

A "sequential social learning model" is one established method of simulating, game-theoretically, situations in which agents are exposed to, and base their decisions off of, previous agents' decisions.

## Information cascades

From Bikchandani, Hirschleifer, and Welch (1992):

> An informational cascade occurs when it is optimal for an individual, having observed the actions of those ahead of him, to follow the behavior of the preceding individual without regard to his own information. Consider the submission of this paper to a journal. The referee will read the paper, assess its quality, and accept or reject it. Suppose that a referee at a second journal learns that the paper was previously rejected. Under the assumption that the referee cannot assess the paper's quality perfectly, knowledge of the prior rejection should tilt him toward rejection. Suppose now that the second journal also rejects and that when the paper is submitted to a third journal, the third referee learns that the paper was rejected at two previous journals.

## Cognitive hierarchy theory and level-k

_See also entry on [[Theory of Mind]]._

A behavioral economics and [[game theory|game-theoretic]] theory of [[intelligence as futures optimization|mutual modeling]]. Its "level-k" framework casts a level-0 player as one who acts irrespective of his predictions of others'; a level-one player models his opponent as a naive level-zero player; a level-two player models his opponents as being level-one, which is to say, his expectations are set by the expectations of a level-zero player. And so on. The premise is that players of strategic games model competitors' behaviors, and that this mutual modeling causes an inferential "depth." We see this kind of thinking in poker, or the famous _Princess Bride_ poison scene. It is also a description of a Keynesean beauty contest, and is the dynamic that causes endgame breakdowns in prisoner dilemmas (mutual anticipation of n-1 round defection).

This phenomenon is closely related to Schilling's concept of focal points, where coordination must occur absent communication based on [[intelligence as futures optimization|mutual modeling]] and expectaiton. Natural Hazard calls it "Sicilian reasoning," after _The Princess Bride_:

> The only thing harder than hitting a moving target is hitting a moving target that is watching you trying to hit it. The best move for you depends on what your opponent thinks their best move is, which depends on what you think your best move is; it's Sicilian reasoning all the way up.

## Keynesian Beauty Contests

"[P]rofessional investment may be likened to those newspaper competitions in which the competitors have to pick out the six prettiest faces from a hundred photographs, the prize being awarded to the competitor whose choice most nearly corresponds to the average preferences of the competitors as a whole; so that each competitor has to pick, not those faces which he himself finds prettiest, but those which he thinks likeliest to catch the fancy of the other competitors, all of whom are looking at the problem from the same point of view. It is not a case of choosing those which, to the best of one’s judgment, are really the prettiest, nor even those which average opinion genuinely thinks the prettiest. We have reached the third degree where we devote our intelligences to anticipating what average opinion expects the average opinion to be. And there are some, I believe, who practise the fourth, fifth and higher degrees." (Keynes, General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, 1936).

An agent with partial information may benefit from observing and copying others' behavior, with the assumption that these "model" agents have information they themselves (the mime) are not privy to. Mimesis exists doubly: first, models are frequently selected based on _others' mimetic and asymmetrical watching_. If many individuals in the mime's sphere are themselves influenced by some model, the mime may then preferentially observe and copy that model as well. 

In many domains, this behavior may be deeply rational. Much of an outfit, or haircut's, value stems from others' opinion of it. In other domains, such as economics, it can lead to bubbles and crashes.

Suspended Reason  6:12 PM
I hear this is the econ channel?
6:14
I'm desperately looking for a phrase to describe the way e.g. in prestige hierarchies, asymmetrical watching/copying is predicated on existing prestige, in other words, people asymmetrically copy people who are already influencers
6:15
it seems like there must be some language in theories of bubbles, hope I'm in the right place
6:15
e.g. the way that when stock starts going up, often people will assume that others are in the know, and basically defer/make decisions based on others decisions

firepotat  6:23 PM
stocks are sometimes called "Keynesian beauty contests" - i.e. participants are not trying to guess the fundamental beauty of the participant (value of the stock) they're trying to guess what everyone else will say the beauty of the participant is.
6:23
this can cause runaway price increases, or decreases, with no change in the "fundamentals" for psychological reasons

6:27
there's lots of ways to generate this phenomenon with varying types/amounts of 'irrationality' among market participants, including none at all.
6:28
but there's a famous paper by brad delong and some others that basically shows that if some % of the market are momentum traders (which are basically traders that look at recent price trends and project them into the future), then the market can make some crazy, irrational swings, even if a large % of the market is capital-R Rational.
6:30
here's Delong citing a bunch of his papers on the topic (idk which one I read, but it was fairly technical) https://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/12/momentum-trading.html
Grasping Reality with Both Hands
Momentum Trading
Robert Waldmann wishes that more people read our work :-). Hoisted from comments: >Grasping Reality with Both Hands: The Semi-Daily Journal of Economist Brad DeLong: Monkeys Trade Assets I: I'm sure you're shocked, shocked that the way to make money is to drive prices away from fundamentals in order to take advantage of momentum traders which you certainly didn't claim that 18 years ago in "Positive Feedback Investment Strategies and Price Destabilizing Rational Speculation," The Journal of Finance vol 65 pp 379-95 (June 1990) (which cited the original Smith et al experiment). >Hot news now, published 18 years ago.

the experimental econ literature on financial markets is also interesting because the core finding is that they almost always see bubbles in their markets.
6:31
the only major exception is when EVERYONE in the market has previous history with the market. replacing only some of them with newbies gets the bubbles to return.
6:31
but idk how useful that is for your purposes.

Suspended Reason  6:34 PM
wowww
6:34
Keynesian beauty contests
6:35
yeah, now that you bring up runaway stuff, it reminds me that sexual selection is largely on this grounds as well
6:35
the best attributes to give your offspring are the ones that future males/females will desire

firepotat  6:36 PM
but.... runaway sexual selection only occurs in highly sexually dimorphic species. (i've been listening to lectures from a stanford course in biology of human behavior today)

Suspended Reason  6:36 PM
Sapolsky's?

firepotat  6:36 PM
yeah

Suspended Reason  6:36 PM
that's a great course, I did it last summer
6:37
the tournament species bit really stuck out
6:37
does that dimorphism requirement change things though?

firepotat  6:37 PM
yeah, that's been the biggest takeaway for me so far
6:37
tournament species = highly sexually dimorphic species (edited) 

Suspended Reason  6:37 PM
wild that you can make such wide behavioral inferences based on skull size of a male vs female

firepotat  6:40 PM
it sounds like what you're pointing out is that many prestige chasers are prestige momentum traders, and like that delong post points out, momentum traders are the ones left holding the bag when the bubble pops

Suspended Reason  6:41 PM
"Keynesian beauty contest" does seem like the most relevant handle here, but given that Keynes saw this effect (preferences predicated on anticipating others' preferences) as the way the stock market operates, I'm shocked there isn't a handle for this kind of behavior. Maybe I'm overcomplicating things and it's just decisional mimesis or something
6:42
yeah I mean, I think prestige is def an example, but so is something like fashion
6:42
probably a lot of career aspiration works this way, in terms of, "I want whatever other people are competing over"
6:43
and this comes up in Girardian mimesis, in Henrich's social learning ideas, in Bourdieu's idea that the payoffs of today determine the behaviors of tomorrow
6:43
I dunno, it's a messy carving, I can't quite clean it up but

[6:01 PM] suspended reason: ok very important
[6:01 PM] suspended reason: what's it called when value is built by the appearance of value
[6:01 PM] suspended reason: or like
[6:01 PM] suspended reason: people preferentially watch/copy others based on how frequently others' themselves preferentially watch/copy others
[6:02 PM] suspended reason: which is also how bubbles form, right? people buy, other people assume they know what they're doing so they buy too, pretty soon it's a pile-on
[6:02 PM] suspended reason: obviously this is a positive feedback loop but there must be a term for its social form that's based purely on, well, suspended reason, a lack of reasons beyond the social
[6:04 PM] doxxed_as_zak: I'm not sure there's a specific word per se, but I like the phrase "aping in" to describe the behavior pattern (in regards to also ignoring sensical systemic risk)
[6:04 PM] suspended reason: hmmm yeah that def seems related
[6:04 PM] suspended reason: there should be a word or phrase
[6:04 PM] suspended reason: or hell even just an eloquent way to describe it blegh
[6:05 PM] suspended reason: it's how prestige works, it's how fashion works, it's how financial bubbles and crashes work, it's how a lot of e.g. hiring decisions get made ("you've been vetted by other people, including your university, so we trust you're good")
[6:05 PM] suspended reason: social/decisional deference?
[6:07 PM] doxxed_as_zak: in what you analogize, there's also a differing of analysis to 'someone more in the know' but still adopting/mimicking behavior
[6:08 PM] doxxed_as_zak: fashion = "they're on the pulse"
[6:08 PM] doxxed_as_zak: bubbles = "they must have some alpha"
[6:08 PM] doxxed_as_zak: hiring = "pedigree must mean something"
[6:10 PM] suspended reason: right
[6:11 PM] suspended reason: there are some legitimate grounds for preferential watching/observation/copying in some cases, like economics
[6:11 PM] suspended reason: but e.g. in fashion the legitimacy is less about being privy to some piece of crucial information, and more about being an influencer to begin with
[6:12 PM] suspended reason: it's the projected "this person will influence, i.e they are already asymetrically observed and copied" that fuels their power
[6:15 PM] doxxed_as_zak: not adding anything in particular, but a while back i was interested in trying to describe fashion-economics on a taste-time spectrum and then later as a function of taste over time with an input of taste-maker-decisions (also changes over time) as well. even if you aren't an influencer, you still have a personal taste that might get massaged by your relationship to an influencer, but it doesn't influencer your whole aesthetic all at once (generally).
[6:17 PM] doxxed_as_zak: there's an interesting dimension of speed in fashion that also impacts 'distribution of knowledge' which is the issue of 'being first to a trend'/not having your (fashion house) style lifted before you display to the public
[6:18 PM] doxxed_as_zak: it's like "publish or perish" but also like "crash early, crash often"
[6:35 PM] suspended reason: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_beauty_contest

[6:45 PM] suspended reason: all the way down??
[6:45 PM] doxxed_as_zak: all the way down
[6:47 PM] suspended reason: seems about right. not sure about the expectation part though, it might not be necessary, i.e. its present in economics and sexual selection, but maybe not so much in prestige-driven mimesis, which is more about observing the here-and-now deference hierarchy of a society in order to figure out who to copy and defer to
[6:48 PM] suspended reason: people watch and copy the people who other people are watching and copying. selection for mimetic models is predicated on mimesis itself! it's mimesis all the way down!!
