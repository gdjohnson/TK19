[[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]]'s theory of the field perceives "intellectual worlds [as] _microcosms_ that have their own structures and their own laws." These structures create [[the space of possibles]] of a given field, and therefore determine (as they are themselves determined by) their productive output.

[[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]]'s 1986 talk at Princeton, "Principles for a Sociology of Cultural Works," defines the literary field:

> one must apply a relation or, if one prefers, a structural mode of thought to the social space of the producers: the social microcosm that I call the literary field is a space of objective relationships among positions—that of the consecrated artist and that of the _artiste maudit_, for example—nd one can only understand what happens there if one locates each agent or each institution in its relationships with all the others. It is this peculiar universe, this "Republic of Letters," with its relations of power and its struggles for the preservation or the transformation of the established order, that is the basis for the strategies of producers, for the form of art they defend, for the alliances they form, for the schools they found, in short, for their specific interests. 

The field is a sort of [[Markov blankets|Markov blanket]]—external events such as political and economic crises "can only have an effect through resulting transformations in the structure of the field." Though this position may seem extreme, [[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]] offers, it I believe, in the spirit of [[torque epistemology]], correcting what he calls the "short circuit" of [[externalist readings]], whereby a social group or situation acts "_directly_, as final cause," on the work, rather than being mediated and exerting influence more indirectly.

# Academic fields

Fields stake out a demesne—a tract of subject matter which they "own," and have exclusive rights to work, as feudal lord of the manor. However, there is a vast discrepancy between what land they claim right to, and the land they actually work (manage, plant, harvest). [[Crispy Chicken]] 2021, "What replaces academic fields of study?":
> The primary problem is basically a cousin of the [[extend-and-retreat|Motte & Bailey issue]]: academics claim that anything within certain parameters belongs to X field, but won’t consider many kinds of studies within those parameters to be publishable in X field. I think of this as the “dinner party problem”: a given topic being discussed at a dinner party can only be discussed in certain ways according to the tastes and attitudes of those present, though this is rarely acknowledged except to say someone went “too far”.

# Intra-field competition

The subversive, avant tendency of new generations of artists is a result of the economics of their fields:

> the impetus behind the process of "banalization" and "de-banalization" [read: [[defamiliarization]]] described by the Russian formalists is not inscribed in the works themselves but rather in the opposition between orthodoxy and heresy which is constitutive of all fields of cultural production and which takes on its paradigmatic form in the religious field. It is significant that Weber, speaking of religion, speaks also of "banalization" or "routinization" and of "de-banalization" or "de-routinization" with regard to the respective functions of priesthood and prophets. The process that carries works along is the product of the struggle among agents who, as a function of their position in the field, of their specific capital, have a stake in conservation, that is, routine and routinization, or in subversion, that is, a return to sources, to an original purity, to heretical criticism and so forth.

Thus, the avant-garde, like the religious prophet, is always in charge of and incentivized toward innovation, disruption, and novelty, while the old guard, clinging to relevance and the [[capital|cultural capital]] they have already accumulated, resist these changes as "heretical."

In general, the position an agent or institution occupies in a field will affect whether it wishes to "preserve or transform" the structure of the distribution of capital, and accordingly, whether to "perpetuate or subvert the existing rules of the game." Still, there is a genetic [[structuralism]] at play revolving around a "legitimate problematic." (Following Althusser, Dennis Shirley 1986 defines a "problematic" as "a politically riddled field of inquiry, requiring its own specific research methods and presupposing possible outcome.") To [[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]], the "legitimate problematic" is [[the space of possibles]] that is "inherited from previous struggles," defining position-takings and orienting the "search for solutions and, as a result, the evolution of production."

# [[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]]: Sociology in Question

> Another property of fields, a less visible one, is that all the agents that are involved in a field share a certain number of fundamental interests, namely everything that is linked to the very existence of the field. This leads to an objective complicity which underlies all the antagonisms. It tends to be forgotten that a  fight presupposes agreement between the antagonists about what it is that is worth fighting about; those points of agreement are held at the level of what 'goes without saying', they are left in the state of doxa, in other words everything that makes the field itself, the game, the stakes, all the presuppositions that one tacitly and even unwittingly accepts by the mere fact of playing, of entering into the game. Those who take part in the struggle help to reproduce the game by helping -more or less completely, depending on the field -to produce belief in the value of the stakes. The new players have to pay an entry fee which consists in recognition of the value of the game (selection and co-option always pay great attention to the indices of commitment to the game, investment in it) and in (practical) knowledge of the principles of the functioning of the game. They are condemned to use the strategies of subversion, but, if they are not to incur exclusion from the game, these strategies have to remain within certain limits. The partial revolutions which constantly occur in fields do not call into question the very foundations of the game, its fundamental axioms, the bedrock of ultimate beliefs on which the whole game is based. On the contrary, in the fields of production of cultural goods -religion, literature or art-heretical subversion claims to be returning to the sources, the origin, the spirit, the authentic essence of the game, in opposition to the banalization and degradation which it  has suffered. (**One of the factors protecting the various games from total revolutions, which could destroy not only the dominant agents and their domination, but the game itself, is the very size of the investment, in time, effort and so on, presupposed by entry into the game. Like the ordeals in rites of passage, this investment helps to make the pure and simple destruction of the game unthinkable in practical terms. Thus whole sectors of culture -with an audience of philologists, I can't help thinking of philology -are saved by the cost entailed in acquiring the knowledge needed even to destroy them with due form**.)
