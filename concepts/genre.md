> what Scruton doesn’t consider is the possibility that that’s the point. To criticize Nirvana or any pop act for this failure is like criticizing the Impressionists for failing to offer sharper, more delineated renderings of their subjects. That wasn’t what these painters were interested in. And so with Nirvana—or Lou Reed, or David Bowie, or David Byrne, or Jay Z, or the Rolling Stones, or Chuck Berry. These artists aren’t in the close-listening business.

# Lifespan

[[Simon Reynolds]], Blissblogger:

> We tend to regard genres as organic or biological entities - as a person (growing through the ages of man: infancy, childhood, adolescence etc etc) or as an ecosystem (evolving, mutating, expanding, assimilating, withering)
>
> But going with that conception of a sound or subculture as a living, growing thing - that leads to the melancholy thought: when a genre achieves adulthood (formative phase completed, influences shaken off) it enters its prime, but that can only ever be a brief moment before the next step, the onset of decline and senescence. With genres, that doesn't take the form of the musical equivalent of arthritis or Alzheimer's, but genres as they age out do mimic one characteristic of the aging mind, which is inflexibility and an inability to generate fresh perceptions or thoughts.

Aloysius, "Burrowing in for the Long Winter":

> the energy that an ecology of talent generates is fragile and unsustainable in the long term. Eventually it dies down. Instead of producing _exciting_ art, the scene increasingly produces _uninspired_ and rigidly _formulaic_ art. Mutual reinforcement and likemindedness—the very features that allowed the scene to flourish in the first place—ossify into orthodoxy.
