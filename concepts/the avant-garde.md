## Bourdieu 1986: Principles for a Sociology of Cultural Works

The subversive, avant tendency of new generations of artists is a result of the economics of their [[fields]]. From Bourdieu's 1986 lecture at Princeton, "Principles for a Sociology of Cultural Works":

> the impetus behind the process of "banalization" and "de-banalization" [read: [[defamiliarization]]] described by the Russian formalists is not inscribed in the works themselves but rather in the opposition between orthodoxy and heresy which is constitutive of all fields of cultural production and which takes on its paradigmatic form in the religious field. It is significant that Weber, speaking of religion, speaks also of "banalization" or "routinization" and of "de-banalization" or "de-routinization" with regard to the respective functions of priesthood and prophets. The process that carries works along is the product of the struggle among agents who, as a function of their position in the field, of their specific capital, have a stake in conservation, that is, routine and routinization, or in subversion, that is, a return to sources, to an original purity, to heretical criticism and so forth.

Thus, the avant-garde, like the religious prophet, is always in charge of and incentivized toward innovation, disruption, and novelty, while the old guard, clinging to relevance and the [[cultural capital]] they have already accumulated, resist these changes as "heretical."

(_Note: this subversion of precedent is isomorphic with a subversion of audience expectations, which are formed through exposure to patterned forms. This isomorphism allows a [[predictive processing]] theory of the avant-garde as offered in "Predictive Hermeneutics."_)

This subversive history of "permanent revolution," and the genetic structuralism of [[the state of possibles]], lead to the field becoming "more and more dependent on the specific history of the field, and more and more independent of external history)." One must know the historic conditions, problems, and possibilities from which a work in these tradition emerges, in order to properly grasp its significance or "contribution." Thus iconoclastic arts are in some sense as situated and historically indebted as those traditional forms of preservation and continuity.

> I'll say one thing for the sixties: the dance profession flourished in a climate of aesthetic freedom it hasn't enjoyed since. Jones's main connection to the sixties experimenters was to the power they'd claimed to control the terms on which they could be artists and be written about as artists. [...] Members of the sixties generation, seeing themselves as picking up where Merce Cunningham's revolution left off, had decided that walking and other forms of non- dance locomotion were in fact dancing. Their authority was John Cage more than it was Cunningham (who continued to use pure-dance movement), and for a few years there was lively controversy in New York over the direction of the new postmodern (as it was then not yet called) modern dance.

Many of the challenging, heretical avant-gardes, such as in French poetry and fiction, have attempted to "strip" all that is typically associated with the form, pushing towards some "pure" form in contrast with the implied degradations or corruptions of the previous, ousted, orthodoxy:

> In the struggles within each genre which oppose the consecrated avant-garde to the new avant-garde, the latter is compelled to question the very foundation of the genre through a return to sources and to the purity of its origins. As a consequence, the history of poetry, the novel or theatre tends to appear as a continuous process of purification through which each of these genres, at the end of a thorough reappraisal of itself, its principles and its presuppositions, finds itself reduced to the most purified quintessence. 

## Discussion

Intriguingly, the trajectory which Croce draws in modern dance, from deconstruction and purification into a kind of "victim art" born in sixties (Vietnam) and eighties (AIDS) activism, mirrors a larger late-20th C shift in high art that Bourdieu, writing in the 1980s, largely misses. By the time of his speaking at Princeton, the visual art world, at least in the United States, had given up on principles of purity a la 70s L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E and was beginning to turn repoliticize. Today, visual arts' dominant frame is arguably one of social justice.
