# DFW on the "Inner Child"

From the 2003 ZDF interview:

**Wallace**: Language like [in that chapter of _Interviews with Hideous Men_], of the wounded inner child, the inner pain, is part of a kind of pop psychological movement in the United States that is a sort of popular Freudianism that has its own paradox which is that the more we are taught to list and resent the things of which we were deprived as children, the more we live in that anger and frustration and the more we remain children. That's a very simple way of putting it, but I think the character in that story is sort of a compendium of kind of all the worst and most painful features of the popular psychology movement in the U.S.
