In the strategic-interactionist picture shared by the work of [[Thomas Schelling]], [[Erving Goffman]], and [[Karl Friston]], ideology can be understood as a high-level synchronization of terminal values and abstract orientations, to minimize friction among coordinating subagents and provide a "script" that bypasses the need for true recursive [[intelligence as futures optimization|mutual modeling]].

The concept of "the exception that proves the rule" is, as Zizek argues, crucial to ideology insofar as ideology is about _explaining away_. A complex situation must be simplified, and this simplification is necessarily incomplete (even setting aside that is is necessarily biased in its incompleteness and completeness, toward supporting the desired functioning of the group). In this way, ideology is a solution to resolving uncertainty on complex topics that defy real understanding, even among expertsâ€”such as matters of the economy, social health, poverty, and geopolitics.
