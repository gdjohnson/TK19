The late turn describes a phenomenon of increased moderation, centrism, reconciliation, or [[generalized compatabilism]] among radical thinkers in their later years. Famous examples include Sontag, Zizek, and Foucault.

## 2020: Conversation with Tyler Cowen

> ŽIŽEK: I am a strange Communist like Marx, who said that one can learn more from a conservative like Balzac than from all progressives about economy. I think that our only true partners, the true leftists today, are modest, intelligent, honest skeptics. Conservatives. This morning, [Cowen] provided the best — I’m grateful for it — the best definition of myself. He told me that he considers me a moderate conservative Communist. 

> ŽIŽEK: I called it more Communism. You know why? People, idiots tell me — “Why don’t you call it socialism?” Everybody is a socialist today. Bill Gates says he’s a socialist, and so on. It’s meaningless. Socialism basically means today you care for society. Hitler cared for society. I don’t care; **I just want to signal that, as you nicely said now, something a little bit more radical will be needed. That’s all I’m saying.**
