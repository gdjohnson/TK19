# Carl Wilson: Let's Talk About Love

> Bourdieu's interpretation was that tastes were serving as strategic tools. While working-class tastes seemed mainly a default (serving at best to express group belongingness and solidarity), for everyone else taste was not only a product of economic and educational background but, as it developed through life, a force mobilized as part of their quest for social status (or what Bourdieu called symbolic power). What we have agreed to call tastes, he said, is an array of symbolic associations we use to set ourselves apart from those whose social ranking is beneath us, and to take aim at the status we think we deserve. Taste is a means of distinguishing ourselves from others, the pursuit of distinction. And its end product is to perpetuate and reproduce the class structure.

This is similar to the social signaling theory, but we can complicate it. For one, we can note that this picture is compatible with a picture where certain tastes emerge naturally from sustained, conscientious, and social interactions with artworks and cultural products. "Learning to see" or appreciate certain modes requires a certain amount of 1) time and 2) access to the cultural-educational resources. Since these abilities are unequally distributed, taste _becomes_ a viable platform for self-distinction to occur.
