What ceases _bellum omnium conta omnes_? All against all?

__public good__: something available to all members of a community, including free-riders

Selection favors self-interest, since self-interest assists survival. There are many cases in which coordinating with others also improves our chances of survival, such as through risk insurance and the undertaking of more ambitious projects, such as hunting big game. But the incentive to self-interest ensures that, when coordinating, it may befit an individual to maximize his benefitting from the coordinated effort while minimizing its cost—his contributed effort, time, or resources. 

Reputation-tracking is one system which intends to prevent such "cheating," or "defection": if one is caught "cheating" in this way, sometimes referred to in folk parlance as "not pulling one's weight," one may be excluded from future group endeavours, the cheater forfitting the benefits reaped through it. 

In order to avoid such costly punishments, individuals might take efforts to _appear_ to cooperate, so long as appearing "as if" is less effortful than actually cooperating (see the entries on [[Opticratics]], [[Dishonesty]], [[Signaling Theory]], and the [[Extend-and-Retreat]] way of being).

The idea of concepts like justice and conscience being a prerequisite to complex social organization dates back to [[Protagoras]] (as represented by Plato):

> men dwelt separately in the beginning, and cities there were none; so that they were being destroyed by the wild beasts, since these were in all ways stronger than they; and although their skill in handiwork was a sufficient aid in respect of food, in their warfare with the beasts it was defective; for as yet they had no civic art, which includes the art of war. So they sought to band themselves together and secure their lives by founding cities. Now as often as they were banded together they did wrong to one another through the lack of civic art, and thus they began to be scattered again and to perish. So Zeus, fearing that our race was in danger of utter destruction, sent Hermes to bring respect and right among men, to the end that there should be regulation of cities and friendly ties to draw them together.

## Wu, Fu, & Wang 2009: Individual’s expulsion to nasty environment promotes cooperation in public goods

Defection (or "free-riding"), in a non-iteratated mixed-group setting, is always game-theoretically optimal:

> The Public Goods Game (PGG) [1] has been widely employed to investigate the evolution of cooperation among self-regarding individuals within the framework of evolutionary [[game theory]] [2–8]. In its simple form, _N_ individuals decide simultaneously whether or not to contribute to a common pool. A cooperator donates an amount of c to the pool but a defector nothing. The sum of these donations is multiplied by an enhancement factor r and then shared equally among all these players irrespective of their contributions. Assuming that there are + cooperators, the payoff for each defector is _PD(k) = r · k · c/N_. Since each cooperator has incurred a cost _c_ of contribution, thus the payoff for him is _PC (k) = PD(k) − c_. With restriction of r being above one, group of cooperators behave better than group of defectors; but condition _r_ < _N_ indicates that defectors would outperform cooperators in any given mixed group under natural selection [9]. The two aspects together give birth to the social dilemma of what is best for the individual (defection) and what is best for the group (cooperation) [10]. (Wu et al, 2009)

Similar to how iteration, reputation, and recognition flip the [[game theory|game-theoretic]] optimality of a [[game theory|prisoner's dilemma]] from defection to tit-for-tat cooperation, individuals in an N-player public goods game can and do make use of what Wu et al. call the adaptation of both strategy and social ties. Cooperators can begin avoiding defectors, and socially segregate to achieve highly cooperative groups. Poor-performing players, meanwhile, may make use of [[social learning]] and begin emulating higher-performing players, leading isolated, struggling defectors to begin cooperating.

(Why is the [[game theory|prisoner's dilemma]] a good simplification of the free rider problem? Vollmer 2013 tells us: "each participant will prefer a situation in which only the other sticks to the cooperative solution.")

## Franzen's Freedom: Athletics and rivalries

> Female athletics was not all sweetness and light, of course. Underneath the hugs were festering rivalries and moral judgments and severe impatience, Shawna blaming Patty for feeding too many outlet passes to Cathy and not enough to her, Patty seething when the slow-witted reserve center Abbie Smith turned yet another possession into a jump ball that she then could not control, Mary Jane Rorabacker nursing an eternal grudge against Cathy for not inviting her to room with her and Patty and Shawna in sophomore year despite their having starred together at St. Paul Central, every starter feeling guiltily relieved when a promising recruit and potential rival underperformed under pressure, etc., etc., etc. But competitive [[sports]] was founded on a trick of devotion, a method of credence, and once it was fully drummed into you, in middle school or high school at the latest, you didn’t have to wonder about anything important when you headed to the gym and suited up, you knew the Answer to the Question, the Answer was the Team, and any venial personal concerns were set aside.

In other words, if decisions about e.g. who to pass to are being made based on nursed grudges, they _aren't_ being fully made to optimize for [[sports|basketball]] criteria like shot-selection. A similar dynamic happens in _The Wire_ with [[institutionality]].

# Signaling toward coordination

# Clippy 2010: To signal effectively, use a non-human, non-stoppable enforcer

Most signaling is dedicated to communicating, honestly,

> I would cooperate with you if and only if (you would cooperate with me if and only if I would cooperate with you).

Or, unpacking this:

> I am slightly more committed to this group’s welfare, particularly to that of its weakest members, than most of its members are. If you suffer a serious loss of [[status]]/well-being I will still help you in order to display affiliation to this group even though you will no longer be in a position to help me. I am substantially more kind and helpful to the people I like and substantially more vindictive and aggressive towards those I dislike. I am generally stable in who I like. I am much more capable and popular than most members of this group, demand appropriate consideration, and grant appropriate consideration to those more capable than myself. I adhere to simple taboos so that my reputation and health are secure and so that I am unlikely to contaminate the reputations or health of my friends. I currently like you and dislike your enemies but I am somewhat inclined towards ambivalence on regarding whether I like you right now so the pay-off would be very great for you if you were to expend resources pleasing me and get me into the stable 'liking you' region of my possible attitudinal space. Once there, I am likely to make a strong commitment to a friendly attitude towards you rather than wasting cognitive resources checking a predictable parameter among my set of derivative preferences.

# Reason 2020: The Dark Miracle of Optics

> Tit-for-tat is exceedingly simple. It enables mutualism (in symbiosis[4]) and is practiced internally to species as diverse as stickleback fish, tree swallows, all primates, bats. All it requires is a sense of continuous identity and tracking of that identity’s (recent-)historical actions. We can take bats as an example: Since mothers’ hunting returns are unequally distributed, but bat babies do better when consistently fed, mothers communally share food. But should a researcher pump up a mother’s gullet full of air, so it appears she had a strong return but is refusing to share, suddenly the other mothers will no longer feed her children, will allow them to starve.

> But vanilla tit-for-tat reputational ledgers, like a barter system, are difficult and costly to continuously verify. It requires small, local communities of recognition, and prevents civilizations from scaling up. And so there was a need for currency, for credit, for the accumulation, transportation, and commensurability of capital, all of which together say: _this individual cooperates_. (Or to generalize across contexts, since optics signal more broadly than mere cooperation: _This individual carries value; an interaction with her will be positive-sum_.) This currency needed to be legible and exchanged across markets, across subcommunities. For these and a thousand other reasons we invented [[surrogation|proxies]], heuristics, measurements; instituted CVs, letters of recommendation, titles of achievement and nobility, and of course, _fashion_. But currency is easily counterfeited.

## Perc, Jordan et al 2017: Statistical physics of human cooperation

> Just like cooperation incurs a cost for the benefit of the common good, so does the provisioning of rewards or sanctions incur a cost for the benefit or harm of the recipients. Individuals that abstain from dispensing such incentives therefore become second-order freeriders, and they are widely believed to be among the biggest impediments to the evolutionary stability of rewarding and punishing. [Panchanathan & Boyd 2004, Hauert, Traulsen, et al 2008; Helbing, Szolnoki et al 2010; Hilbe, Traulsen 2012]

# Promises & self-binding

_See also [[Strategic Interaction]] entry._

A promise is a commitment to a timeline, to a fork in the road. The promiser self-binds to a future course of action, or a future state of events over which he has control. This instills confidence in those who witness the promise, whose own futures are interdependent with the promiser’s (as all our futures are). This confidence allows tacit coordination: to meet at a location, to start a business, to forge a relationship. Often promises are performed “on the record” and for a large, public crowd, such that the reputational stakes of breaking a promise are expanded.

What do we know about commitments? All commitments have stakes; the default stake is reputation. A commitment can be believed because what has been staked—what will be lost, if the commitment is reneged on—is costlier than what might be gained through defecting on a commitment. In this way, one who commits to a path is intervening in the structure of their own incentives, re-aligning them in order that cooperation—following through on the commitment—is, legibly, the most rational course of self-interested action he can take.

Remember, the commitment is a social technology that only works if certain criteria are met. Enforcement is crucial: the punishments accorded to those who repeatedly abuse our accords is precisely what makes such accords viable as coordination technologies. Without punishments, self-binding would be impossible—there would be no “cost” to defecting, and thus no trustworthy incentive not to. A society without punishment is a society without trust.

# Morality as a cooperation technology

Richard Alexander, emphasis added:

> We have these things that philosophers call 'moral systems'. It is instructive to realize that these systems tend to just go to the boundaries of the group, they tend not to include the members of other groups. Across the decades moral philosophers and other people have gradually come to the idea that **moral systems are systems for keeping competing individuals together, by prescribing not to infringe beyond a certain point on the rights of others**. I think that morality might have begun as the honouring by males of the pairbonds between other males and females. That would involve something very dear to everyone, namely the integrity of the family, and it would also involve that thing which is distinctly human, namely that we are able to get along with multiple males in the group.
