# John Vervaeke 2019: Letter to [[David Chapman]]

On 2019's _Joker_ film:

> Has the vacancy of the [[zombies|zombie]] been replaced by the violent absurdity of the Joker because of the recent malevolent political appropriation of absurdism in the service of narcissism? Narcissism is the last ditch defence of decadent [[narrative]] ontology. It is the idolatry of narrative trying absurdly to become self-causing and self-sufficient because it anxiously knows it has no cosmic warrant.

> the name Arthur Fleck by juxtaposing the name of a great mythological king with that of useless superficial castoff matter is instantiating into the heart of the character the very absurdity that I am discussing.  Absurdity is the juxtaposing of such contrasting and mutually undermining perspectives. 

 # [[Sarah Perry]]: Ritual and the Consciousness Monoculture

> Since sources of meaning and value are now so rare, the self has had to take on the novel burden of providing value and fulfillment (an idealized future state that justifies unpleasantness in the present), as in the novel modern idea of the “career.”

Quoting Baumeister: 

> When people say they need to find themselves, often what they really mean is that they want a meaningful life…. People have always had selves, but selves have not always had to carry the burden of supplying meaning to life in such a far-reaching fashion. The reason for the modern fascination with the self, then, is that the self has been made into a fundamental and powerful source of value in modern life.

> The assumption is that your work will elevate you to a position of eminence that will elicit respect, admiration, and acclaim from others, as well as allowing you to feel self-respect and self-esteem. Many people hold some mythical view of career success that promises personal fulfillment. They imagine that reaching certain goals will be automatically accompanied by living happily ever after.
