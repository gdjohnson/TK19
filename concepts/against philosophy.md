# Stove, "What Is Wrong With Our Thoughts"

> A damning verdict therefore follows, on past human thought: a verdict essentially the same as the one which was pronounced on it by the eighteenth century Enlightenment, and repeated, with even greater vehemence, by the Logical Positivists in the twentieth century. Of course it is a verdict against most past thought, not against all of it. Exempted from it are, for example, Greek mathematics in antiquity, and most importantly of course, natural science in the period since Copernicus: this being the ground on which the Enlightenment in general, and Logical Positivism in particular, took its stand. But both Greek mathematics and modern science are, in the overall historical scene, mere points of light in a boundless and impenetrable darkness

Plato, Kant, and Hegel are "two-legged plagues"; the history of philosophy (or "philosopholatry") is a "vast repository of sick men's dreams."

# Latour 2004: Why has critique run out of steam

See [[torque epistemology]] for main entry on Latour 2004, and the "supply of arms" by poststructuralist thought to conspiratorial thinking.

> What has critique become when a French general, no, a marshal of critique, namely, Jean Baudrillard, claims in a published book that the Twin Towers destroyed themselves under their own weight, so to speak, undermined by the utter nihilism inherent in capitalism itself—as if the terrorist planes were pulled to suicide by the powerful attraction of this black hole of nothingness?

# Why might we expect philosophy to be riddled with bad thinking?

## The difficulty of evaluating and selecting the best thoughts

Phil Goetz, [LessWrong comment](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EdyDGRLNFScEt5uDz/what-is-wrong-with-our-thoughts?commentId=MrsGRNbFbcirssL3a)

> There is a bandpass filter on philosophy, and it has both a low and a high cutoff. We propagate knowledge by collective judgements about it. In fields where we can't eliminate bad ideas by experiment, both the very worst and the very best ideas must be rejected. The requirement that an influential philosopher appeal to a large group of philosophers guarantees that relatively simplistic, self-aggrandizing or at least inoffensive crap with enough fuzziness to give one leeway in how to interpret it will be favored over careful, complex, a-polite ideas.

## Cognitive bias and cope

Stove 1991 proposes certain cognitive biases underly many philosophical theories:

> Plato, Aquinas, Descartes, Kant, flattered and deluded man that he will live for ever; or that he is not really even a part of the physical universe at all; or that he is the whole point of the existence of the physical universe; or even that the physical universe depends upon, indeed is constituted by, man's thought of it!

This is the idea that philosophy is a history of "cope." The alternative, more charitable frame is that philosophy, as understood by the Greeks and Romans, was separate from meta-philosophy and was itself largely a therapeutic program for the good life, for virtuous living and mental health. This is the tradition, for instance, of the Stoics and Epicureans, and one which was reborn with [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]. 

Chesteron, for instance, criticized pragmatism on such grounds: "Pragmatism is a matter of human needs, and one of the first of human needs is to be something more than a pragmatist." Here we can see also the writings of [[William James]] on the will to believe. Dewey responded to Chesterton's critique with enthusiasm, writing in "The Need for a Recovery of Philosophy" that "when it ceases to be a device for dealing with the problems of philosophers and becomes a method, cultivated by philosophers, for dealing with the problems of men."

See also [[William James]] 1907, "The history of philosophy is to a great extent that of a certain clash of human temperaments": 

> Treated as it often is, this question becomes little more than a conflict between aesthetic preferences. Matter is gross, coarse, crass, muddy; spirit is pure, elevated, noble; and since it is more consonant with the dignity of the universe to give the primacy in it to what appears superior, spirit must be affirmed as the ruling principle. To treat abstract principles as finalities, before which our intellects may come to rest in a state of admiring contemplation, is the great rationalist failing. Spiritualism, as often held, may be simply a state of admiration for one kind, and of dislike for another kind, of abstraction. I remember a worthy spiritualist professor who always referred to materialism as the 'mud-philosophy,' and deemed it thereby refuted.

# Self-selection effects

Bertrand Russell advocates a [[Selection]] argument: "Hitherto the people attracted to philosophy have been mostly those who loved the big generalizations, which were all wrong, so that few people with exact minds have taken up the subject."

Luke Muehlhauser similarly argues there is a selection effect happening where, Kant and Plato being thinkers whose reasoning and beliefs are deeply flawed, or "inexact," something which is clear to the more advanced students, who are turned off from the discipline by its nonsensicality—but which is not clear to less exact thinkers, beginning a selective cycle for further incoherence.

# [[conceptual analysis]]

## Against the Logicians 2014: What is wrong with academic philosophy today?

> When I say “academic philosophy,” I have in mind the sort of mindless linguistic puzzle-playing celebrated each year in the Philosopher’s Annual. The most acclaimed and ostensibly serious work being undertaken by professional philosophers in most English-speaking philosophy departments today.

> Of course, there is a great deal of very important and valuable work being done by relatively professionally marginal figures who happen to remain employed by departments of philosophy, and by philosophers who work in professionally second-class fields such as the history of philosophy and political philosophy. Countless academics working on philosophy outside of philosophy departments continue to do real intellectual work. And who knows, maybe the latest generation of young philosophers is already rejecting the kind of virtuosic non-thinking on display in the Philosopher’s Annual. Maybe they’ll remake the face of professional philosophy — if any of them succeed in getting jobs.

> [...]

> In my experience, no one who has read and understands the later [[Wittgenstein]] — let’s say, no one who is capable of imitating the kinds of discussions of philosophical problems that appear in the later Wittgenstein — persists in thinking that the kinds of puzzles tinkered with in the pages of the leading philosophy journals can be solved.

> Yet academic philosophy persists in viewing itself as the home of the most rigorous forms of critical reasoning. A place where damning critiques go unanswered for over a century, and obvious errors persist for decades while the virtuoso puzzlers charge unthinkingly ahead. Many philosophers — to this day — even seem unwilling to acknowledge the pervasive and highly questionable role of intuitions throughout their arguments.

This is not a new set of events, however.

> philosophy has been dominated in nearly every age by scholasticism and technical fireworks. Then the age passes, the scholastics are forgotten, and their critics — [[Socrates]], Montaigne, [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], and on and on — remain.

## Against the Logicians 2014: Peter Unger, Raymond Geuss, and internal criticism of academic philosophy

> A friend who was considering applying to graduate school in philosophy once told me that a professor described what the graduate programs are looking for as follows: they want someone who will be able to “push the ball forward.” The professors want to know that their graduate students will engage with the professors’ problems in a productive way, participating in the same problem-solving methods that the professors use — for example, clarifying puzzles by drawing creative new distinctions involving obscure and highly technical philosophical concepts.

> Needless to say, if this is the requirement for becoming a professional philosopher, then quite a few kinds of philosophers need not apply. Such as philosophers who ask questions and resist asserting answers, or philosophers who view the adoption of dogmatic philosophical positions as arbitrary and pointless. Oddly enough, any philosopher with the perspicuity to understand the futility of the puzzle-playing philosophers’ methods will probably struggle to be heard and understood in an American philosophy department today, much less employed. In effect, a kind of blindered credulousness is now a prerequisite for entering and rising in a field that is ostensibly defined by its commitment to unrelenting critical inquiry.

## Marcus Arvan 2014

Arvan re-iterates the critique of [[conceptual analysis]] I and so many others, since [[Wittgenstein]], have tried hammering home:

> I’ve been thinking more and more lately about a worry about analytic philosophy that traces back at least to [[Wittgenstein]], and which is enjoying a resurgence (see e.g. Millikan’s Dewey Lecture, Avner Baz’ recent paper which I commented on here, and Balaguer’s paper on compatibilism and [[conceptual analysis]], which I commented on here). The worry is simply this: analytic philosophy is, by and large, predicated on a systematic misunderstanding and misuse of language.

> Analytic philosophy, broadly speaking, is dominated by [[conceptual analysis]]. I do not mean to say that this is all analytic philosophy is (I take myself to be doing analytic philosophy here, for instance, though I am not analyzing concepts). The point is simply that, in large part, analytic philosophy has been the practice of philosophers aiming to rigorously tease out — through thought-experiments, definitions, etc. — our concepts of free will, justice, morality, etc. But this is not all. In engaging in [[conceptual analysis]], analytic philosophers take themselves to be doing a second thing: namely, getting at the referents of the terms, i.e. what free will is, what justice is, etc.

> I increasingly think — and so do Millikan, Baz, and Balaguer — that this approach to philosophy is doubly wrong. First, it is based on a misunderstanding of language. I think [[Wittgenstein]] (and Millikan) were both right to suggest that our words (and concepts) have no determinate meaning. Rather, we use words and concepts in fundamentally, irreducibly messy ways — ways that fluctuate from moment to moment, and from speaker/thinker to speaker/thinker. A simpler way to put this is that our concepts — of “free will”, “justice” etc. — are all, in a certain way, defective. There is no determinate meaning to the terms “free will”, etc., and thus philosophical investigation into what “free will” is will be likely to lead, well, almost everywhere. At times, we use “free will” to refer (vaguely) to “reason-responsiveness”, or to “actual choices”, or whatever — but there is no fact of the matter which of these is really free will. Similarly, as Balaguer points out in another paper, there is no fact of the matter whether Millianism, or Fregeanism, or whatever about the meaning of proper names is right. All of these positions are right — which is just to say none of them are uniquely right. We can, and do, use proper names in a myriad of ways. The idea that there is some fact of the matter about what “free will” picks out, or what names mean, etc., all fundamentally misunderstand natural language.

> And there is an even deeper problem: all of it is hollow semantics anyway. Allow me to explain. In his paper on compatibilism and [[conceptual analysis]], Balaguer gives the following example. Two psychologists, or linguists, or whatever are trying to figure out what a “planet” is. They then debate to no end whether Pluto is a planet. They engage in philosophical arguments, thought-experiments, etc. They debate the philosophical implications of both sides of the debate (what follows if Pluto is a planet? What follows if it is not?). Here, Balaguer says, is something obvious: they are not doing astronomy. Indeed, they are not really doing anything other than semantics. And notice: there may not be a fact of the matter of what “planet” refers to, and it does not even matter. What matters is not what the concept refers to (what is a planet?), but rather the stuff in the world beyond the concepts (i.e. how does that thing — Pluto — behave? what is its composition? etc.).
