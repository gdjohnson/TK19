# Reflexive constitution

Reality isn’t socially constructed—it’s reflexively constituted.

Territories shape maps shape territories. "Sophist" is derived from the Greek word for wisdom, and it was Protagoras (at least, according to Plato) who, as a tutor of rhetoric and virtue, first self-consciously called himself a sophist as an advertisement for his position and role. Soon he was followed by many other tutors, until the definition of sophist as tutor, and not merely as a person of wisdom (as it had signified previously), was established. But the real-world troubles of the sophists, as a group, led to a decline in their reputation; the death of [[Socrates]] was, some scholars argue, an over-response to the excesses of the sophists (to whom Socrates was aligned primarily in name, if not in practice; he did not charge fees for his instructions, nor claim to tutor wisdom, but was sentenced for the crime of the category’s “typicals”). By the time of Plato and Aristotle, "sophist" had become somewhat of an insult, and in their wake, it would come to be reshaped into its modern usage, as one who cleverly misleads through fallacy. 

In other words, an abstract descriptor (map) of a qualitative value was voluntarily coupled with a real-world group (territory), and as that group's reputation soured, so too did the connotations and eventually the full meaning of the original descriptor. The word was "anchored" to a quality, and then became anchored instead to a group which claimed to possess that quality, and thus as their reputation changed in Athens, so too did the word's meaning, which indirectly derives from its anchor in the territory (mediated by others' use of it, which is affected by their feelings toward the territory)
