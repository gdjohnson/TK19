## Northrop Frye:

> Civilizations which stress the desirable rather than the real, and the religious as opposed to the scientific perspective, think of drama almost entirely in terms of comedy. In the classical drama of India, we are told, the tragic ending was regarded as bad taste.

# Comedy

In Shakespeare's time, a few types of comedy dominated.

1. Aristophenic ("Old") comedy: satirical, corrective, dialectical, mocking political, and often conservative. Era-specific, i.e. "timely" and easily dated.
2. Roman ("New") comedy: Renaissance origins; ends in marriage; frequently populated by a cast of rival suitors, fathers; driven by money problems, social conflict. 
3. Festive ("Green world") comedy: physical and bodily, mapped onto natural seasons or cycles, featuring holiday and release, the heterotopic forest.
