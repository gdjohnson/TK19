# Beer 2009: The Decline of Middle America and the Problem of Meritocracy

## Self-sorting and the rise of the cosmopolitan creative class

> Richard Florida has hopefully labeled this trend “the rise of the creative class.” Florida reports that over the last thirty-odd years we have witnessed an ever-increasing concentration of college graduates around “superstar cities” or “means metros”-San Francisco, Washington, Denver, New York, Seattle, and the like. Thus, while 20 percent of the adult population holds an advanced degree in cities like San Fran and DC, the numbers are 5 percent in Cleveland and 4 percent in Detroit. Florida’s maps show in graphic imagery the hiving of college grads around certain metropolitan areas, a hiving that has emerged most clearly since 1970. Save for a few isolated exceptions, those hives are not located in Middle America, including our many mid-sized middle American cities.

> Florida foresees a future in which the most talented and creative live among themselves in select city cores, and in which they are “catered to by an underclass of service workers living in far-off suburbs.” “Accommodating” this new geographically based cognitive sorting, he maintains, “will be one of the great political and cultural challenges of the next generation.”

> fly-over country, by and large, has been hemorrhaging intellectual capital for decades. The most talented young men and women, the most able, the most intelligent and creative, have been leaving to go off to college — or have been lured off to college — only to return in ever-diminishing numbers.

This "luring" is performed by mass media, cultural narratives, economic theory, and job opportunities. It results in a "cognitive ability stratification" whereby meritocracy, "inevitably," gives rise to exacerbated inequality. "[I]n order for talent to triumph it must be mobile"—a direct line between meritocracy and the collapse of [[localism]]. To enable this mobility, a romanticized, restless cosmopolitanism—and removal of all its obstacles—is necessary:

> It seeks to remove the barriers posed by tradition or culture — that is, barriers posed by institutions, texts, myths, habits, social forms, sensibilities, affections, characteristic practices, and the like — to the mobility of the intelligent. Thus, the more perfect the meritocracy, which we typically equate with justice itself, the more mobility — both geographic and social — is required, until talent is able to flow freely to where it can command the highest price.

The result is geographic sorting:

> Susan McWilliams has pointed out how this geographic sorting takes place at a micro level, as well, with adjacent suburbs increasingly divided cleanly among income and class lines. This fact is reflected in our popular culture. In the teen-oriented movies of the 1980s, like _Pretty in Pink_ or _Breakfast Club_, much of the action tended to revolve around the intensely felt differences between the rich kid and the poor kid-but at least these kids knew each other, and even went to the same high school. However, by the early 2000s, shows like _The OC_ were, McWilliams writes, “premised on the notion that poor kids and rich kids do not grow up in the same place.”  Much of the show’s drama “trades on the assumption that even a slight variation in geography—town, region, area code—is coeval with a great variation in socioeconomic class.”

_See also Gossip Girl in the 2000s._

The self-sorting causes elites to become "dangerously isolated" from neighbors (Lasch 1995) in their formation of a "new aristocracy of brains." Middle America is imagined as "technologically backward, politically reactionary, repressive in its sexual morality, middlebrow in its taste, smug and complacent, dull and dowdy." Elites, meanwhile, "are at home only in transit, en route to a high-level conference, to the grand opening of a new franchise, to an international film festival, or to an undiscovered resort. Theirs is essentially a tourist's view of the world." We enter a world of "abstractions and images" alienated from physicality, the only circumstances, Lasch writes, under which academic theories of "the social construction fo reality" could flourish.

## Against meritocracy

Cases against meritocracy have been made by Edmund Burke (_Reflections on the Revolution in France_), Justus Moser ("No Promotion According to Merit" 1770), Wendell Berry, Christopher Lasch (_The Revolt of the Elites_ 1995) and the Swiss economist Wilhelm Röpke. All these thinkers are what Beer calls "realists" on individual differences—the deep and intractable problem of the genetic lottery, more or less—but nonetheless critique meritocratic systems of advancement as dignity-effacing. Some, like Charles Murray, see in eugenics a potential fix to "the problem of individual differences"; others wish to curtail inequalities through government intervention. Beer believes both fall short.

> Meritocracy, in the definition I am using here, is an ideology that maintains that one’s place in society should be determined solely by one’s “merit”—by which is meant the tangible evidence of one’s talents, capabilities, intelligence, and, of course, will.

> Meritocracy, on this conception, is not only inextricable from the globalization and centralization trends mentioned above but offers an ideological [[narrative]] that gives those trends meaning and justification—if it couldn’t in fact be said to _structure_ those trends.

Upward mobility, Berry writes, serves (Beer paraphases) "fundamentally as a way of justifying an exploitative, 'original-discovery' mentality that served the needs of industrial economies but not those of actual communities." In this framing, meritocracy uses "impersonal technology (e.g., the SAT) to help us identify valuable natural resources (bright kids), and then pitilessly removes them from their ecological contexts (local communities), never to return them, thus creating cultural landscapes just as ravaged as the denuded mountainsides of Kentucky coal country."

Extending Beer, we could theorize _master merit_ and _slave merit_. The former is a deservingness based on human capital contribution, or "worth." The latter is based on human ethical weight, sometimes called "innocence." This has much in common with Graeber's idea on exchange. From the [[Debt]] entry:

> He splits up systems of distribution—of the "giving and taking of things"—into communistic ("according to means and need"), exchange (strict, means-agnostic ends-reciprocity), and hierarchy (debt according to social position).

## Politics of resentment

> As long as humans have their “present nature and passions,” says [Justus] Moser [(1770)], a system of doling out awards and honors according to merit alone can only produce confusion and resentment. As things stand now, on the other hand, “people can think to their comfort: fortune and not merit has elevated these. . . . But if everything went according to merit, this so necessary comfort would completely disappear, and the cobbler [who] can flatter himself that he would be doing something entirely different from mending the Lady Mayor’s slippers if merit were respected in this world could not possibly be happy.”

Röpke writes that a public narrative of meritocracy means leaving behind the "face-saving and acceptable excuse of social injustice and lowly birth." Extending his thought, we might argue that modern politics of resentment and class are a way of reclaiming that face-saving excuse—to displace blame external to the self (legitimately or not).
