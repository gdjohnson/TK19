Paul Graham: "Why do hackers care so much about free speech? Partly, I think, because innovation is so important in software, and innovation and heresy are practically the same thing. Good hackers develop a habit of questioning everything."

# Tradition in Arendt & Mann

*Mann 1947: Dr. Faustus*

> Buchel was a property of a size corresponding to the ownership of a team and cattle; it was a good fifty acres of meadow and ploughed land, with communal rights to the adjoining mixed woodland and a very comfortable wood and frame dwelling-house on a stone foundation. With the lofts and stalls it formed an open square in the centre of which stood a never-to-be-forgotten ancient linden tree of mighty growth. The beautiful tree may have been a little in the way of the traffic in the courtyard: I have heard that each heir in turn in his young years, on practical grounds, always maintained against his father's veto that it ought to be cut down; only one day, having succeeded to the property, to protect it in the same way from his own son.

*Arendt 1954: What Is Authority?*

> With the loss of tradition we have lost the thread which safely guided us through the vast realms of the past, but this thread was also the chain fettering each successive generation to a predetermined aspect of the past. It could be that only now will the past open up to us with unexpected freshness and tell us things no one has yet had ears to hear... But it cannot be denied [that we] are in danger of forgetting... [of losing[ the dimension of depth in human existence. For memory and depth are the same, or rather, depth cannot be reached by man except through remembrance.

# Gopnik 2019: A separate kind of intelligence

_The explore-exploit tradeoff in computation:_

> In neuroscience, you see this pattern of development where you start out with this very plastic system with lots of local connection, and then you have a tipping point where that turns into a system that has fewer connections but much stronger, more long-distance connections. It isn’t just a continuous process of development. So, you start out with a system that’s very plastic but not very efficient, and that turns into a system that’s very efficient and not very plastic and flexible.

A good way of thinking about this strategy may be that it’s a way of resolving the explore-exploit tradeoffs that you see all the time in AI. One of the problems that you have characteristically in AI is that as you get a greater range of solutions that seem to be moving in the direction of a system that’s more intelligent, a system that understands the world in more different ways, what you also have is a big expansion of the search problem. If there are many more different things that you can do, how can you search through that space more effectively?

_Child development as simulated annealing:_

One way to solve that problem that comes out of computer science is to start out with a very wide-ranging exploration of the space, including parts that might turn out to be unprofitable, and then gradually narrow in on solutions that are going to be more effective. My slogan is that you could think about childhood as evolution’s way of doing simulated annealing. It’s evolution’s way of starting out with a very high temperature, broad search and then narrowing it. The problem with a high temperature search is that you could be spending a lot of time considering solutions that aren’t very effective, and if you’re considering solutions that aren’t effective, you aren’t going to be very good at effectively acting in the world, performing the four Fs and doing all the other things that we need to do as adults.

_Psychedelics and synaptogenesis:_

> Recently, I've been interested in looking at psychedelic chemicals, which seem to have the rather surprising effect of putting adult brains back into a state of plasticity that looks much more like childhood brains. So, the effect of psychedelic drugs neurally is that it increases the local connections and breaks the long-distance network connections. It literally induces plasticity and induces more synaptogenesis. The ones that have been studied the most are psilocybin, LSD, MDMA, and ketamine, all of which have the same phenomenological properties. They also all turn out to have this same neural effect of driving the system back to something that looks more like childhood plasticity, which may be an interesting way of testing some of those ideas.

> One of my slogans is that you could think about psychedelics as doing for the individual what childhood does for the culture: It takes a system that’s relatively rigid and injects a bunch of noise and variability into the system, shakes it out of its local optima and lets it settle into something new. 

# Noë 2015: Strange Tools

> Art, really, is an engagement with the ways our practices, techniques, and technologies organize us, and it is, finally, a way to understand our organization and, inevitably, to reorganize ourselves.

In this way it is a practice akin to [[defamiliarization]]: by breaking us out of the unconscious ready-to-hand, from recognition into sight proper, we get a chance to remake our organized structures.

Choreography is an art form, to Noë; dance, meanwhile, is an organized activity. Choreography "casts light on one of the ways we are organized"—"To stage a dance is to put into view this organized activity within which we are, by nature, embedded but within which we are, as we tend to be, lost."

> Technology is not mere stuff. It is the equipment with which we carry on our organized activities. Technologies organize us; properly understood, they are _evolving patterns of organization_.

We can continue these technologies as we inherit them, or else innovate and interrogate them in the light of new contexts.

Inevitably, our behavior is mimetic; it is filled with [[conformity]]:

> When we dress ourselves, we respond to—we sample, cite, and play with—the looks of others, as we have found these recorded in painting and photography. And we do so with an eye to how we ourselves would show up in pictures.
