# Self-naming

The guiding principle of self-naming is not so much accuracy as it is reasonably accurate self-flattery. Only a fool would choose a self-descriptor which put him in poor light. And thus, names self-ascribed can never quite be trusted. Sometimes we reify names, treat the part as a whole, as if the descriptor was chosen for its precise consistency: _How hypocritical that one who is "Pro-Life" is also in support of the death penalty_; _If one opposes antiFa, one must necessarily be a fascist_. Susan Haack accuses Rorty of a misleading self-description as pragmatist, strategically quoting his confession that what he dubbed as such "might also be called 'left-wing Kuhnianism'." 

Sometimes, the angle of flattery is less-than-obvious: a claim which would be uncontroversial in one discourse is attributed, contextually, to another, in order to appear subversive and challenging. Or take the case of Zizek, whose self-label of _communist_ was explicitly strategic in a [[torque epistemology]] framework. From his debate with Jordan Peterson in Toronto, 2019:

> I know it’s provocative to call this a plea for communism, I do it a little bit to provoke things.

And from his conversation with Tyler Cowen, 2020:

> I called it more Communism. You know why? People, idiots tell me — “Why don’t you call it socialism?” Everybody is a socialist today. Bill Gates says he’s a socialist, and so on. It’s meaningless. Socialism basically means today you care for society. Hitler cared for society. I don’t care; **I just want to signal that, as you nicely said now, something a little bit more radical will be needed. That’s all I’m saying.**

## Examples

"Sophist" is derived from the Greek word for wisdom, and it was Protagoras (at least, according to Plato) who, as a tutor of rhetoric and virtue, first self-consciously called himself a sophist, as an advertisement for his position and role. Soon he was followed by many other tutors, until the definition of sophist _as_ tutor, and not merely a person of wisdom (as it had been before), was established. But the real-world troubles of the sophists, as a group, led to a decline in their reputation; the death of [[Socrates]] is arguably an overresponse to the excesses of the sophists (to whom Socrates was aligned primarily in name, and not in practice; he did not charge fees for his instructions, nor claim to tutor wisdom). By the time of Plato and Aristotle, "sophist" had become somewhat of an insult, and in their wake, it would come to be redefined entirely, into its modern usage, as one who cleverly misleads through fallacy. In other words, an abstract descriptor (map) of a qualitative value was voluntarily coupled with a real-world group (territory), and as that group's reputation soured, so too did the connotations and eventually the full meaning of the original descriptor. The word was "anchored" to a quality, and then became anchored instead to a group which claimed to possess that quality, and thus as their reputation changed in Athens, so too did the word's meaning, which indirectly derives from its anchor in the territory (mediated by others' _use_ of it, which is affected by their feelings toward the territory).

# Bourdieu on the social efficacy of naming

_All quotes unless otherwise marked are from SYMBOLIC LANGUAGE, 1991._

## The neccessity of studying naming in social science:

> [social scientists] must examine the part played by words in the construction of social reality and the contribution which the struggle over classifications, a dimension of all class struggles, makes to the constitution of classes—classes defined in terms of age, sex or social position, but also clans, tribes, ethnic groups or nations.

> In short, social science must include in its theory of the social world a theory of the theory effect which, by helping to impose a more or less authorized way of seeing the social world, helps to construct the reality of that world.

## The neo-Kantian idea that language structures reality:

> So far as the social world is concerned, the neo-Kantian theory, which gives language and, more generally, representations a specifically symbolic efficacy in the construction of reality, is perfectly justified. By structuring the perception which social agents have of the social world, thea ct of naming helps to establish the structure of this world, and does so all the more significantly the more widely it is recognized, i.e. authorized.

## Through language, we constantly try to create and effect the world: 

> There is no social agent who does not aspire, as far as his circumstances permit, to have the power to name and to create the world through naming: gossip, slander, lies, insults, commendations, criticisms, arguments and praises are all daily and petty manifestations of the solemn and collective acts of naming, be they celebrations or condemnations, which are performed by generally recognized authorities.

## Only some actors have the authority to name

> In the struggly to impose the legitimate vision, in which science itself is inevitably caught up, agents possess power in proportion to their symbolic capital, i.e. in proportion to the recognition they receive from the group. The authority that underlies the performative efficacy of discourse is a _percipi_, a being-known, which allows a _percipere_ to be imposed, or, more precisely, which allows the consensus concerning the meaning of the social world which grounds common sense to be imposed officially, i.e. in front of everyone and in the name of everyone. 

_Note: see also common knowledge._

Citing [[J.L. Austin]], _How to do Things with Words_:

> Suppose, for example, I see a vessel on the stocks, walk up and smash the bottle hung at the stem, proclaim 'I name this ship the Mr Stalin' and for good measure kick away the chocks: but the trouble is, I was not the person chose to name it...

# Linguistic inflation

[[C.S. Peirce]], "Ethics of Terminology":

> Whoever deliberately uses a word... in any other sense than that which was conferred upon it by its sole rightful creator commits a shameful offence... [For] philosophical conceptions which vary by a hair's breadth from those fo which suitable terms exist, to invent terms with a due regard for the usages of philosophical terminology.
