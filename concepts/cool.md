# Robert Pogue Harrison on Jim Morrison

> Cool does not crave. But our age is craven.

> Our age is too hot... Its politics are hot.

> Morrison always withheld something, even when he appeared to let it all hang out... In the final analysis, Apollo always dominated over Dionysius.

Cool is never in a rush; it's always on its own time. Cool is slow, instead of frenzied.

> The cool doesn't give away what it has, but holds on to it with discrimination.
