# Overview
![[simulacraProgression.png]]

The rationalist concept "simulacra," while it takes its lead from Baudrillard, departs in several key ways. As a very quick distillation of the rationalist concept of simulacra:

* L-1 and L-2 are concerned with the literal content of the message.
* L-3 and L-4 are concerned with the social reputation of the message.
* L-1 and L-3 are "honest" signals, that reflect some real state (either the content or social position of the speaker, respectively).
* L-2 and L-4 are "dishonest" signals, that attempt to bring about some consequence through a message.

## Ben Hoffman: Synopsis & Interpretation of Simulacra's Levels

> 1. First, words were used to maintain shared accounting. We described reality intersubjectively in order to build shared maps, the better to navigate our environment. I say that the food source is over there, so that our band can move towards or away from it when situationally appropriate, or so people can make other inferences based on this knowledge.
> 
> 2. The breakdown of naive intersubjectivity – people start taking the shared map as an object to be manipulated, rather than part of their own subjectivity. For instance, I might say there’s a lion over somewhere where I know there’s food, in order to hoard access to that resource for idiosyncratic advantage. Thus, the map drifts from reality, and we start dissociating from the maps we make.
> 
> 3. When maps drift far enough from reality, in some cases people aren’t even parsing it as though it had a literal specific objective meaning that grounds out in some verifiable external test outside of social reality. Instead, the map becomes a sort of command language for coordinating actions and feelings. “There’s food over there” is perhaps construed as a bid to move in that direction, and evaluated as though it were that call to action. Any argument for or against the implied call to action is conflated with an argument for or against the proposition literally asserted. This is how arguments become soldiers. Any attempt to simply investigate the literal truth of the proposition is considered at best naive and at worst politically irresponsible. But since this usage is parasitic on the old map structure that was meant to describe something outside the system of describers, language is still structured in terms of reification and objectivity, so it substantively resembles something with descriptive power, or “aboutness.” For instance, while you cannot acquire a physician’s privileges and social role simply by providing clear evidence of your ability to heal others, those privileges are still justified in terms of pseudo-consequentialist arguments about expertise in healing.
> 
> 4. Finally, the pseudostructure itself becomes perceptible as an object that can be manipulated, the pseudocorrespondence breaks down, and all assertions are nothing but moves in an ever-shifting game where you’re trying to think a bit ahead of the others (for positional advantage), but not too far ahead.

In other words, we begin with a "naive" or "honest signaling" relationship of map to territory, but this relation is quickly complicated in levels 2-4. The second level is mere deception concerning the object level; it "scams" those who take the utterance naively as the first level. 

In the third level, the map becomes untethered from a territory relation: an utterance is no longer taken as communicating its literal content, but communicating some subtextual, rhetorical, or social message. Rather than a statement about the structure of the world, it is a "meta-map"; the purpose of a linguistic utterance shifts in 1 & 2 from "literalism" to a "rhetoricism" (or "motivational epistemics." Hoffman writes, _Any argument for or against the implied call to action is conflated with an argument for or against the proposition literally asserted. This is how arguments become soldiers._ My understanding of the relationship between the third and fourth level is still confused, but it appears that, just as level 2 "scams" level 1, level 4 "scams" level 3.

The understanding and use of language by individuals as primarily operating the first two levels can be called [[Literalism]]. The understanding and use of language on the third and fourth levels is similar to what Grietzer calls "motivational epistemics" in _Amerikkkkka_, and evidences a ready-to-hand embodiment of [[torque epistemology]].

# [[Zvi]] 2020: Simulacra Levels & their Interactions

### Level 1 statements as honest signaling

> [L-1] statements correspond to object-level truth. If everyone makes [L-1] statements, everyone’s map improves. Decisions get better. Action that has good object-level consequences can be taken. People can be trusted in a pure sense.

### Taboo & the unsayable

> if things are too forsaken, one _loses the ability to communicate about the lion at all_. There is no combination of sounds one can make that makes people think there is an actual lion across an actual river that will actually eat them if they cross the river.

In other words, the loss of literalist content, and people's ability to parse utterances literally, means certain true facts become unsayable—not in an instrumental, polite fiction sense ("that may well be true or plausible, but we shouldn't circulate it in polite society") but in an erased, taboo sense where the connotative and historical baggage (the social metadata) of an utterance is so thick and superimposed on the content that the content becomes invisible. As a result, these knowledges cannot be circulated, and soon fall out of memory, leading to potential catastrophes from a lack of foresight. If I interpret [[Zvi]] correctly, he sees COVID-19 as one of these cases.

### Roles: Tricksters, drones, lawyers

__Trickster__

[[Zvi]] frames the difference in levels one and two as content (V) vs. consequence (C). He calls "trickers" those who only consider, and communicate based on, the consequences of a communication. "The Trickster says V if they think C > ~C. They say ~V if they think ~C > C." It becomes easy, he writes, "once you know they're a trickster, to trust a Trickster in their own way. You simply interpret their statements as manipulations rather than observations."

__Drone__

The Drone is a pure L-3 operator; its belief is "naively" one-to-one with the "belief of what their side is currently advocating." 

__Agent__

The Drone is contrasted by the Agent, who (depending on factoring) comprises levels 2 and 4 or levels 1, 2, and 4. While [[Zvi]] positions only L-3 purists as Drones, one might argue that a pure L-1 player is equally a slave to the territory, and can only report the truth even when it is deeply against his own interests (see Kant's thought experiment of the axe murderer).

__Lawyer__

> Alternatively, one can be an advocate for a side that presents the case in the best possible light, while only making true statements. [...] One can call this communication strategy The Lawyer. The Lawyer will say only things that have positive impact on level 1 and positive impact on level 3. Alternatively, they might say only things that have positive impact on level 1 and positive combined impact on levels 2 and 3. Or they might need to fulfill all three requirements. 

### Science vs. Politics

In [[Zvi]]'s frame, "facts vs. politics," adapted here for procedural and semantic consistency. (_Fields_ of discursive norms.)

"Facts Don't Matter is the dominance of level 3+4 considerations over level 1+2 considerations." Relation to the territory has become irrelevant; what surplaces it is the words' "impact on my membership in my coalition, and the success of myself and that coalition in playing political games." [[Zvi]] continues:

> To the purely political actor, the implausible lie is better. If the lie is implausible, then those repeating it have sent a costly signal of loyalty, and cut ties with lower levels. You don’t have to worry they repeated the statement because it happens to match the physical world, or that they will refuse to repeat the next one if it fails to match. 

As [[Friedrich Hayek|Hayek]] writes in "The Use of Knowledge in a Society" (1945), systems of "planning," in which decisions are made about the allocation of resources, is prone to the problem of persuasion. Whereas evolutionary processes select what "just works," processes of human intelligence are subject to an enormous number of biases with respect to associative heuristics and cognitive biases. Charisma, "truthiness," and the fashion field (along with self-interested incentives of self-preservation, documented endlessly by NNT) win out when those who approve and fund different plans have insufficient expertise in the target domain, and make use human-centered heuristics instead. In other words, it is a matter of _talking_ one's way into resources. 

### Intent and interpretation

> All actions and statements operate on all four levels at once, to the extent that they have implications on those levels. 

> The [[intent]] of a statement is often entirely on one level. That’s not how humans or Bayesians interpret an action. If you want to improve the physical world without having any higher-level side effects, that’s going to require extra effort. Avoiding meaningful implications on levels 2, 3 and 4 is _hard work_. The same bleeding effect occurs when aiming for higher levels, as well.

# Simulacra, correctives, and overleans

Rhetorical _overleans_—situations in which a speaker wishes to _twist the stick in the other direction_—are clearly pertinent here, since they are manipulations of the social graph (or the author's perception of the current opinion of his audience). It is "rhetoricizing" and "motivational" and "corrective"—and yet it does not fit cleanly into the structure Hoffman enumerates. This may entail a revamping of the structure to accomodate it.

Right now, Hoffman's factoring, following Baudrillard's tightly couples social reception and atmosphere (how things are taken) with intentionality (how things are meant). Separating them, we might potentially frame the overlean as a L-4 utterance positioning itself as L-1, but this seems to break the spirit of the concept. 

# Simulacra & the Gervais Principle

__posturetalk__
: manipulative displays and unquestioned allegiance (L-2, L-3) that are transparently performed

__babytalk__
: L-2 and L-4 to an oblivious audience

__powertalk__
: L-2 and L-4 treated as facts about power and public opinion; it is straight-talk about optics

# Simulacra and reality entertainment

Reality entertainment: mixes of non-fiction and fiction, happening live or semi-live, which maintain kayfabe. Reality television, professional wrestling, tabloid and celebrity culture.

Sharon Mazer, "The game of life": 

> We were proud of being "smart" [that is, in on the con], even as we looked, obsessively it seemed, to "mark out" [as in dope out, by becoming a naive mark], to catch a glimpse of the real: anger or fear, pain, blood, force, victimisation and vindiction. The moments when we saw (or thought we were seeing) the wrestlers shoot their way past the confines of the codified improvisation were the payoffs for playing along with the con otherwise.

## Enlightened false consciousness

Quoting D. S. Moon 2020 ("Kayfabe, Smartdom and Marking Out: Can Pro-Wrestling Help Us Understand Donald Trump?"), there is an aspect in reality entertainment of what Zizek calls "enlightened false consciousness" or "cynical ideology": each individual feels himself to be "smart," while the other members of the crowd are "marks." In enlightened false consciousness, 

> one ‘believes through the other’: as Sharpe and Boucher (2010: 55) summarise, "Although I am not taken in by the ideological ‘bullshit’, I believe through the Others, whom I suppose do truly believe. These Others are the dupes; I keep my inner distance."

Moon writes:

> This depiction is backed up by ethnographic work interviewing fans at pro-wrestling events who, as Ford (2016: 40–41) relates, ‘wanted to ensure I was aware that, while they realised the show was staged, many of the others who attended wrestling matches didn’t (even though my interviews indicated that must be an extreme minority)’.
