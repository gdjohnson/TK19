Different levels of abstraction mean that different claims which, on surface, appear contradictory can in fact be reconciled. The view that art production is a form of human signaling is compatible with a view of art's contents as meaningful, beautiful, etc.

# Deleuze Seminar on Leibniz, 1980

> Depending on Leibniz’s correspondent or on the public to which he addressed himself, he presented his whole system at a particular level. Imagine that his system is made of levels more or less tightened or more or less relaxed; in order to explain something to someone, he goes to situate himself on a particular level of his system. Let us assume that the someone in question was suspected by Leibniz of having a mediocre intelligence: very well, he is delighted, he situates himself on one of the lowest levels of his system, and if he addresses someone of higher intelligence, he jumps to a higher level. As these levels belong implicitly to Leibniz’s own texts, that creates a great problem of commentary. It’s complicated because, in my opinion, one can never rely on a Leibniz text if one has not first discerned the level of the system to which this text corresponds.

> For example, there are texts in which Leibniz explains what, according to him, is the union of soul and body, fine, and it’s to one particular correspondent; to another correspondent, he will explain that there is no problem in the union of soul and body since the real problem is that of the relation of souls to one another. The two things are not at all contradictory, it’s two levels of the system. The result is that if one does not evaluate the level of a Leibniz text, then one will get the impression that he constantly contradicts himself, when in fact, he does not contradict himself at all.

# Holland 2012: Signals and Boundaries

> Because of the enclosure-within-enclosure-within-enclosure form of [CAS] niches, it is necessary to pick a "lowest level" at which to lay out a corresponding network. The lowest level is typically chosen as a set of easily distinguishable components relevant to a question of interest. For example, in studying the global economy, we could choose industries as the lowest-level agents. Of course, these "lowest-level" components can often be further decomposed into still lower-level components, proceeding step by step to the level of atoms or below. But **inappropriate levels of decomposition can make it difficult to answer the question of interest.**

Management is the job of "weaving disparate parts into a coherent whole using well-specified overarching goals" (Mannheim 2016) and solve principle-agent problems. 

# Korzybski's Abstraction Ladder

_See also [[general semantics]] entry._

To Korzybski, abstraction is directly opposed to specification. We climb the abstraction ladder from "Bessie the cow" to "cow" to "livestock" to "farm asset" to "asset" to "capital."

Individuals converse at different levels of abstraction, leading to communication breakdowns. Hayakawa quoting Wendell Johnson, _People In Quandaries_:
> The low-level speaker frustrates you because he leaves you with no direction as to what to do with the basketful of information he has given you. The high-level speaker frustrates you because he simply doesn't tell you what he is talking about.

Hayakawa:
> interesting speech, as well as clear thinking and psychological well-being, require th constant interplay of verbal levels with the nonverbal ("object") levels. In science, this interplay goes on constantly, hypotheses being checked against observations, predictictions against extensional results.

> The work of good novelists and poets also represents this constant interplay between higher and lower levels of abstraction. A "significant" novelist or poet is one whose message has a high level of _general_ usefulness in persuasiveness through an ability to observe and describe actual social situations and states of mind. A memorable literary character, such as Sinclair Lewis's George F. Babbitt, has _descriptive_ validity (at a low level of abstraction) as the picture of an individual, as well as a _general_ valididty as a picture of a "typical" American businessman of his time. [See also [[compression]] and [[inexact sciences]] entries.]

These abstraction levels often go from what Hayakawa calls "report" to "inference" to "judgment":

> Report: "May Smith didn't get in until three last Saturday night."
> Inference: "I bet she was out fooling around!"
> Judgment: "She's a tramp. I never did like her looks. I knew it the moment I first laid eyes on her."
