## Robert Jackall, _[[Moral Mazes]]_:

> As a former vice-president of a large firm says: “What is right in the corporation is not what is right in a man’s home or in his church. What is right in the corporation is what the guy above you wants from you. That’s what morality is in the corporation.” 

> The key interlocking mechanism of this structure is its reporting system. Each manager gathers up the profit targets or other objectives of his or her subordinates and, with these, formulates his commitments to his boss; this boss takes these commitments and those of his other subordinates, and in turn makes a commitment to his boss... It is characteristic of this authority system that details are pushed down and credit is pulled up.

__On the subordination of self for the org:__
> However, the belief of insiders in abstract goals is not a prerequisite for personal success; belief in and subordination to individuals who articulate organizational goals is. One must, however, to be successful in a bureaucratic work situation, be able to act, at a moment’s notice, as if official reality is the only reality.

> Proper management of one’s external appearances simply signals to one’s peers and to one’s superiors that one is prepared to undertake other kinds of self-adaptation. Managers also stress the need to exercise iron self-control and to have the ability to mask all emotion and intention behind bland, smiling, and agreeable public faces.

> The price of bureaucratic power is a relentlessly methodical subjection of one’s impulses, at least in public.

__Distinction:__
> Perceptions of pervasive mediocrity breed an endless quest for social distinctions even of a minor sort that might give one an “edge,” enable one to “step out of the crowd,” or at least serve as a basis for individual claims to privilege. 

__In what could pass as a description of the [[artworld]]:__
> Instead, success becomes contingent on others’ interpretations of one’s performance, leading to a break in the accepted moral economy between talent combined with effort and reward. This makes compulsive sociability an occupational virtue, as one attempts to discern and shape peers’ and superiors’ interpretations.

__Tainting & social distancing:__
> ...social distancing has two purposes: it undermines in advance or lays the groundwork for refusal of any claims that a person considered a failure might make on another, and it forestalls the possibility of being linked with that person in others’ cognitive maps. This becomes particularly important when there has been a known past association between oneself and one thought to have failed in some way... In fact, when it is even suspected that a person might be headed for trouble, anticipatory avoidance is the rule.

__Groupthink:__
> one can only criticize something when one has the resources to solve it in a clear and decisive way. Otherwise, one should keep one’s skepticism to oneself and get “on board.”
