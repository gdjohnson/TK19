Slippage is a concept from poetry and art.

In ethnographic theory, Graeber and Da Col write, in their kickoff essay for HAU, "Above all, we see ethnography as a pragmatic inquiry into conceptual disjunctures." These disjunctures, or "unclassifiable remainders" "rearrange preconceived notions and categories"; they open the possibility of paradigm shift, in the Kuhnian sense:

> d most of us probably agree that 95% of what we learn in the field (whether Tibet, Madagascar or upper-class London) quickly comes to make intuitive “sense” to us. As for the remaining 5%, it is not so much incomprehensible, utterly alien, as excessive—at least in terms of the efforts required for its conceptualization. HAU is especially interested in hosting “ethnographic translations” of those excessive remainders, remainders or wonders that arise when worlds are (happily, productively) out of joint.

Meanwhile, Hofstadter is interested in linguistic slippages as a window into how language works.
