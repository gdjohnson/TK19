The Internet epoch, we learn, is the Golden Age of masks. ([[Nick Land]])

## Sontag 1966: Against Interpretation

> As Cocteau writes: "Decorative style has never existed. Style is the soul, and unfortunately with us the soul assumes the form of the body." Even if one were to define style as the manner of our appearing, this by no means necessarily entails an opposition between a style that one assumes and one’s "true" being. In fact, such a disjunction is extremely rare. In almost every case, our manner of appearing is our manner of being. The mask is the face.

## Thomas McEvilley on the Rubin primitivism show 1984, quoted in Malcolm 1986: A Girl of the Zeitgeist

> In their native contexts these objects [i.e. primitive masks] were invested with feelings of awe and dread, not of esthetic ennoblement. They were seen usually in motion, at night, in closed dark spaces, by flickering torchlight. Their viewers were under the influence of ritual, communal identification feelings, and often alcohol or drugs; above all, they were activated by the presence within or among the objects themselves of the shaman, acting out the usually terrifying power represented by the mask or icon. What was at stake for the viewer was not esthetic appreciation but loss of self in identification with and support of the shamanic performance."

## Noë 2015: Strange Tools

> Because style is an abiding and defining facet of our perceptual and cognitive lives, pop music’s concern with style should not be construed as superficial or trite. Indeed, we can bring this distinction out by noticing that there is, to my way of thinking, a tight connection between the very concept of a person and the concept of style. In its original, etymological meaning, a person is a mask; from there this word (“person”) acquired the meaning of a role, as in, the role played in a drama by an actor who wears a mask (as in “dramatis personae”). The face of a person is a mask, and the person, in truth, is a role, not the one who plays the role.

The mask is shaped in response—to _fit_ to—the ambient pressures which make up the success or failure criteria in a social setting:

> Personhood is performed, I said above. This brings me to the second linked idea: that of performance. In one sense, “to perform” is simply the most general verb of action. We perform actions in the course of our lives. But it is also possible to distinguish between things we simply do and the actions that, in doing, we perform. It is a difficult exercise to figure out just what principle marks that line, but it has something to do with the fact that when we perform, as distinct merely from acting, we act in view of the evaluation or standards or rules and norms of others. We speak of sexual performance, performance on the job, athletic performance, performance at school, and, of course, performance on the stage. Whether you are actually subject to the evaluation of another—maybe you are practicing handstands in your room or making drawings for your eyes only—you are still performing, for what you do is open to the possible, if not the actual, assessment of others. And crucially, that’s how we experience it, too. The fact that you are alone rarely ever means you are truly alone, for almost everything we do is framed by the roles we are playing and the standards to which we are subject. Can you think of exceptions?

> Turning to art, we can now appreciate why it is that performance is, as in some sense it is, the most fundamental of all the arts. The performing artist makes these facts about our lives raw material for his or her own practice. We are fundamentally performers. Not as a matter of choice, and not as a matter of biology, but as an inescapable condition of being a person. A performing artist is one who places himself or herself on the stage and says, “Watch me do what I do,” all the while knowing that you are watching him or her do it.

# Depersonalization and modernism

## Davis 2007: Nothing Personal

> Customers demand Emotion Recollected in Tranquility. But that's a recipe for Dirty Bathwater Consommé, and, come the health inspectors, what's the chef gonna say? Canny neurotics long ago learned the value of (a pretense of) depersonalization, from Yeats's Hallowe'en masks and Eliot's "It's Trad, Dad!" through Berryman's minstrel show to Merrill's Weejee board and Forché's Hollywood foreign correspondent. Still, their weak point should be pretty obvious.

# Authenticity and the departure of masks

## Johnstone: Impro

> Suppose an eight-year-old writes a story about being chased down a mouse-hole by a monstrous spider. It’ll be perceived as “childish” and no one will worry. If he writes the same story when he’s fourteen it may be taken as a sign of mental abnormality. Creating a story, or painting a picture, or making up a poem lay an adolescent wide open to criticism. He therefore has to fake everything so that he appears “sensitive” or “witty” or “tough” or “intelligent” according to the image he’s trying to establish in the eyes of other people. If he believed he was a transmitter, rather than a creator, then we’d be able to see what his talents really were.
>
> We have an idea that art is self-expression—which historically is weird. An artist used to be seen as a medium through which something else operated. He was a servant of the God. Maybe a mask-maker would have fasted and prayed for a week before he had a vision of the Mask he was to carve, because no one wanted to see his Mask, they wanted to see the God’s. When Eskimos believed that each piece of bone only had one shape inside it, then the artist didn’t have to “think up” an idea. He had to wait until he knew what was in there—and this is crucial. When he’d finished carving his friends couldn’t say ‘I’m a bit worried about that Nanook at the third igloo’, but only, ‘He made a mess getting that out!’ or ‘There are some very odd bits of bone about these days.’ These days of course the Eskimos get booklets giving illustrations of what will sell, but before we infected them, they were in contact with a source of inspiration that we are not. It’s no wonder that our artists are aberrant characters. It’s not surprising that great African sculptors end up carving coffee tables, or that the talent of our children dies the moment we expect them to become adult. Once we believe that art is self-expression, then the individual can be criticised not only for his skill or lack of skill, but simply for being what he is.

> Schiller wrote of a ‘watcher at the gates of the mind’, who examines ideas too closely. He said that in the case of the creative mind ‘the intellect has withdrawn its watcher from the gates, and the ideas rush in pell-mell, and only then does it review and inspect the multitude.’ He said that uncreative people ‘are ashamed of the momentary passing madness which is found in all real creators . . . regarded in isolation, an idea may be quite insignificant, and venturesome in the extreme, but it may acquire importance from an idea that follows it; perhaps in collation with other ideas which seem equally absurd, it may be capable of furnishing a very serviceable link.’

# [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Noietzsche]] 1878: Human, All Too Human

> If someone obstinately and for a long time wants to appear something it is int he end hard for him to be anything else. The profession of almost every man, even that of the artist, begins with hypocrisy, with an imitation from without, with a copying of what is most effective. He who is always wearing a mask of a friendly countenance must finally acquire a power over benevolent moods without which the impression of friendliness cannot be obtained - and finally these acquire power over him, he is benevolent.

# Robert Ezra Park 1950: Race and Culture

> It is probably no mere historical accident that the word person, in its first meaning, is a mask. .. In a sense, and insofar as this mask represents the conception we have formed of ourselves—the role we are striving to live up to—this mask is our truer self, the self we would like to be. In the end, our conception of our role becomes second nature and an integral part of our personality. We come into the world as individuals, achieve character, and become persons.

The masks we play eventually come to feel natural:

# Culture trend: facelessness

A video circulates, a man with glasses, face tight to the camera; superimposed text reads, "i cut away hair / i give up beauty / i throw away shampoo / i empty my cabinet / i delete photo / i forget my history / i care about myself / i life for the moment." Someone comments "but ur on tik tok" so he shuts off comments; "what a guy" @aenzly comments on Twitter. Which is the paradox of facelessness, the paradox of "leave society," the paradox of exit. If you're around to tell anyone, you haven't left. Besides, why would you leave, when so much symbolic capital—"clout" as the kids call it—is on the table for branded facelessness?

## Dean Kissick: Downward Spiral

> Life has become a performance, a rather banal and meaningless one. That may have been the case for centuries, but even more so now. The only thing we can make now is ourselves; day after day, again and again. To sculpt one’s own individuality has ballooned into an endless task. To post every day, to express yourself creatively, to have opinions on the churning discourse.

> Some dude brought a copy of Camille Paglia’s _Sexual Personae: Art and Decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson_ (1990) to my gym and read it between sets. I went to a party in Midtown in summer thrown by the Ions, a pair of anonymous podcasters who wear masks and disguise their voices, and spoke to a young lady on the balcony who said she’d dropped out of art school to become a “persona”. That makes a lot of sense for the present, and she’s doing very well.

> We live in an attention economy, and the self is the key unit of exchange.

> For many seasons, Balenciaga’s Instagram was a roll of photos solicited from alternative influencers, from pale, sickly artists and dour, misshapen scene kids, eager to make themselves into advertisements for around $500 a post; but on July 1st this year, the brand deleted everything, unmade itself, and turned to a blank page. By late July, Kanye West, under Gvasalia’s creative direction, was wandering the stands of Atlanta’s football stadium in a series of masks. And last month, September, Gvasalia accompanied the rapper’s estranged wife, Kim, to the Met Ball in matching all-black outfits and body stockings that obscured their faces completely. Demna and Kim, this century’s most influential and effective forces of branding and self-branding respectively, are now involved in the destruction of identity. Kim and Kanye are divorcing one another, but also themselves. And Demna’s black-hooded, faceless penitent getup from the masked ball also closed Balenciaga’s [Spring ’22](https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2022-ready-to-wear/balenciaga#gallery-collection) show, and was the first picture posted on its wiped-clean Instagram.
