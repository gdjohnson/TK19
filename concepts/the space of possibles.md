# Bourdieu 1986: Principles for a Sociology of Cultural Works

> Fields of cultural production propose to those who are involved in them a _space of possibles_ that tends to orient their research, even without their knowing it, by defining the universe of problems, references, intellectual benchmarks (often constituted by the names of its leading figures), concepts in -ism, in short, all that one must have in the back of one's mind in order to be in the game. 

This psychic presence of the space of possibles (which we might call a _habitus_, i.e. a "feel for the game")...

> ...is what differentiates, for example, the professionals from the amateurs, or, to use a painter's idiom, the 'naifs'

It is a "system of common reference" that creates a situatedness and relation between contemporary actors in a field. 

## The space of possibles is not deterministic but influential and guiding

> The relation that is established between the available positions and the position-takings does not entail a mechanistic determination. All agents, writers, artists or intellectuals construct their own creative project according, first of all, to their perception of the available possibilities afforded by the categories of perception and appreciation inscribed in their habitus through a certain trajectory and, secondly, to their predisposition to take advantage of or reject those possibilities in accordance with the interests associated with their position in the game.

> By entering the game, [[agents]] tacitly accept the constraints and the possibilities inherent in that game (which are presented not in the form of rules, but rather as possible winning strategies).

Bourdieu himself sees himself as embarking on a theoretical inquiry that can help free him from the determinations of the space of possibles:

> This is why—if I may be permitted a parenthesis and a reflexive look back on what I am trying to do—it is so important, if one is to have a bit of freedom from the constraints of the field, to attempt to explore the limits of the theoretical box in which one is imprisoned. This, in my view, is the principal function of theoretical culture: to provide the means for knowing what one is doing and for freeing oneself from the naiveté associated with the lack of consciousness of one's bounds.
