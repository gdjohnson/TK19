Much cultural value comes from discovering lost treasures (see [[knowledge logistics]]—knowledge is only as useful as it is accessible; curation and preservation are as valuable as novel production) or for arguing the value of otherwise dismissed objects (see [[poptimism vs rockism|poptimism]]). Y-Combinator was founded to fund start-ups that would not have received funding otherwise; Emergent Ventures to give grants to applicants who would otherwise be given them. In all these cases, one is "playing the market" by purchasing stock that is undervalued, and foregoing stock that is properly- or over-valued.
