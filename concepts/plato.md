## Neoplatonism

Neoplatonism reigned over alternate philosophies throughout the medieval period up to the twelfth century, carried by thinkers like Augustine, Boethius, and Pseudo-Dionysus. His dialogues were popular in the Byzantine Empire and Italy, and while Platonism disappeared briefly after the twelfth century, the translation work of Ficino helped restore it during the Renaissance.
