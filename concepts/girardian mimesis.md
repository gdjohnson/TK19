[[René Girard|Girard]] offers a theory much like the mimetics of [[social learning]] theorized by Joe Henrich. Humans, in order to learn, require _models_—but it is not merely this model's behavior that he picks up and imitates, but the model's _desires_, the objects to which the behavioral practices are directed; the two are intertwined. 

This "acquisitive mimesis" leads to a set of commonly desired objects and states, be they social, sexual, or material, and thus the community evolves into a competition between members for these (scarce and mutually desired) ends. This, for [[René Girard|Girard]], underlies human conflict, and indeed, human conflict is largely a mirroring-based escalation, where a combative attitude in one breeds a combative attitude in another; the pair become "doubles" as they cybernetically escalate.

Scapegoating is the crucial mechanism of resolving and de-escalating conflict: a sacrifice is required as a symbolic destruction of the conflict's origins, in both the sense of causal and ethical culpability.

# Literary examples

In [[Jane Austen]]'s _Emma_, Emma realizes she is in love with Mr. Knightley only after she worries that he is enamored with her friend Harriet. Similarly, it is only when Mr. Knightley believes that Frank Churchill is enamored with Emma that he comes to realize his own love for her.
