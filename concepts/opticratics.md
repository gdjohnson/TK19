"The first duty in life is to assume a pose. What the second is, no one has yet discovered." (Oscar Wilde)

"In this battlefield, popular perceptions and rumor are more influential than the facts and more powerful than a hundred tanks." (David Kilcullen, _Counterinsurgency_)

"Authenticity has been weaponized. It’s a term that’s really been abused. You can almost say today’s society is characterized by an authenticity-industrial complex. We’re more concerned with appearing real than being real." (Eric Hu, _SSense_)

"Authenticity has come to mean 'well-integrated social performance.'" (Crystal Cultures)

"The attentive pupil who wishes to _be_ attentive, his eyes riveted on the teacher, his ears open wide, so exhausts himself in playing the attentive role that he ends up by no longer hearing anything." (Sartre)

“How, simply on the basis of patterns of stimulation across the sensory receptors, can embodied, situated brains alter and adapt so as to act as useful nodes (ones that incur considerable metabolic expense) for the origination of adaptive response? Notice how different this conception is to ones in which the problem is posed as one of establishing a mapping relation between environmental and inner states. The task is not to find such a mapping but to infer the nature of the signal source (the world) from just the varying input signal itself.” (Andy Clark, Surfing Uncertainty)

In *[[_True Blood_]]*, when Bill proposes to Sukie, she panics and doesn't know what or how to feel, so she flees to the restaurant bathroom. As she collects herself, she catches her gaze in the mirror, begins to look at herself try his engagement ring on; she stops crying, starts to smile—and makes up her mind to accept. By seeing her image she learns who she is and what she wants.

We know not to to judge books by covers; we are aware of wolves in sheep's clothing; but practically, we resort again and again to appearances. In our defense, we have nothing else to go on; in condemnation, we often would do well to suspend our judgment longer, to continue learning in modesty. But life is limited. The world is knocking. What option is afforded us?

Self-consciousness and social anxiety are felt concern over how one "comes off." Humiliation and embarrassment are negative emotions in the wake of believing one's reputation has been damaged.

## Intro

So much freedom to choose, and so much regret. An increasingly marketplace society, fueled by desire, overwhelmed by options, and characterized by poor choices. Capital at stake, and competitive pressure on suppliers to serve their clients: the theoretical alignment of provider and purchaser is premised on perfect information, which is everywhere absent in practice. What is really being selected for? Can it be more obvious that we do not choose based on which option is superior for our purposes, but on which _appears_, to _us_, superior? 

Looking to the most sclerotic and dysfunctional arenas of our society—politics, policing, academia, institutionalized art, among others—suggests that one of the main problems of the modern world is of a much softer type than the traditional corruption. Our society is not so much meritocratic as it is _opticratic_: to be seen _is to have_ power, just as being seen to have power is _also_ to have it; and power is awarded not so much on the basis of "actual" merit, but on the basis of its appearance. This is at once utterly obvious—one’s impression of an object is all one can, "ultimately," operate off, and thus there is "no other way"—and at the same time seriously non-trivial: the translation of holistic quality to public appearance is lossier than usually assumed or acted-upon, and the effects of this lossiness far more economically, psychologically, and spiritually damaging than we typically suppose.

Any situation of asymmetric information—in which one party's claims cannot be verified, or are hugely costly to verify—is a situation in which it is to the presenting party's benefit to bullshit, to put on the best public-facing image rather than the reality. Researchers across [[signaling theory]], ethology, and [[game theory]] have emphasized how crucial a role deception plays in inter-agent systems, and yet we continue to see deception as the noise to accurate information's signal. Instead, it points to something far more fundamental: accurate information and deception alike are subsets of _strategic representation_, the ability of agents (perhaps more accurately, "actors") to influence other agents through representations. Here we'll explore the optimization of appearances—"optics-mization," if we are feeling cute—as the most prevalent and successful strategy of deception, which is so banal and common that humans treat it like water (that is, ignore it).

A theory of opticracy bundles [[girardian mimesis|Girardian theories of mimetic desire]], Joe Henrich's theories of prestige-based social learning, the syllogisms of [[status]], the fields of [[strategic interaction]] and impression management, Bourdieusean symbolic [[capital]], ethological [[signaling theory]], the metonymic nature of "reading," and the concepts of [[fetish]] and [[surrogation]]. We will unpack these connections as we work through the piece.

As far back as the beginning of written history, we find reminders that appearances do not equal reality, that perception can deceive. The more metaphysical, philosophical lineage of this impulse is born out in Plato's cave, the "supersensory" realm beyond our sensory apprehension, the reality beyond our grasp. The more microsociological, everyday wisdom tradition plays out in warnings against fraud, flattery, and deception, actors' ability to strategically produce appearances that are false. (See for instance the Arabic and Hebrew _maqamat_, the _Kalīla wa-Dimna_, Aesop's fables, and similar wisdom collections.)

## The lexical hypothesis 

If we were living in an _opticratic_ society—a way of being not imposed top-down by a regime, but participatory and largely intractable (i.e. timeless)—we would expect a rich vocabulary for describing features of it. This is especially true given that such linguistic concepts would increase the fitness of their users, would be a cultural technology for recognizing deception and thus avoiding its consequences. And indeed we do see that vocabulary.

To _self-promote_ is to present the best image of oneself publicly, and to spread word of one's merits. One may engage in _self-praise_, _self-glorification_, _boasting_, _bragging_, and _self-aggrandizement_; may _grandstand_ or be _flashy_. To _front_ is to present a very specific public _facade_: One _primps_ and _grooms_ so as to put on the best possible public impression. The institutional version of this practice is known as _marketing_, _propaganda_, _Potemkin_[^1], and _public relations_; these practices produce the _promotional_ or _puff_ piece, which is full of _flummery_. 

The _meretricious_ is that which appears to have value—has the _facade_ of value—but is not valuable in actuality. It is closely related to the _specious_ and the _spurious_—that which appears valid but isn't. _Goldbricks_ are items metaphorically coated in gold but composed of adobe; _snake oil_ is a purported cure-all with a mystical marketing campaign and an over-the-counter chemical composition. Things are _tinsel_ if they shine but are cheap, i.e., are made of a metal that is not rare but common; similar showiness without underlying quality is called _tawdry_ or _ostentatious_. To be virtually identical but somehow lack the “essence” or identity is to be a _forgery_ or _counterfeit_; to attempt an imitation and fall short is to be a _knock-off_.

We may put a "spin" on a story, share it in the "best light," put a "good face" on it, or cut to the chase with a full-blown PR job. (Strategic [[framing|conceptualization]]—a question of framing, analogy, and the always-ideological act of compression, what is kept in versus left out.) Statistics are "massaged," or just "damn lies"; statistical significance is p-hacked.

The _pretentious_ is the false claim to—and advertisement of—cultural capital, taste, or status; in England, those who pretense to the nobility are _toffee-noses_. In language, this behavior is _grandiloquence_; in style, it is _chi chi_; in moral matters, it may be called "cant"—a "whining pretension to goodness, in formal and affected terms."^[Samuel Johnson] In matters of academics and thought, since the 16th C we have had the term _bomphiologia_, or _verborum bombus_: "when small & triflyng thynges are set out wyth great gasyng wordes."^[Rhetorician Richard Sherry, _A treatise of Schemes & Tropes_ 1550.] 

Those who claim to have a skillset, or realm of knowledge, which they in reality lack are called _charlatans_,^[From Italian _ciarlatano_, from _ciarlare_, to babble. The swindly is performed linguistically: a slightly alternate world is presented where the only deviations from reality are those necessary to the swindling; all others are liabilities that increase the cognitive burden of simulation in the swindler, and increase the risk of damage to his credibility.], or _mountebanks_. Those who in general gain the trust of another, and lead them to false premises for self-interested purposes, are _con men_, _imposters_, and _frauds_; they are involved in _hoaxes_ and _shams_. 

In general, those who present a person they are not “present a second set of books,” are _phoney_, _inauthentic_, or _fakes_. In the right, rarified Twitter circles and messageboards, they are _pseuds_ or _poseurs_. They _feign_, _contrive_, _trump-up_, _masquerade_, and _fabricate_. 

And of course there is _bullshit_, _humbug_, _claptrap_, and somewhat lesser in degree, the _exaggeration_ (literary: _hyperbole_). We have the legal-speak _suggestio falsi_, "indirect verbal deception" (Black 1982). And at the far end of the spectrum, unhinidered dishonesty: the lie.

## The social self

What does it really look like, though, to live in an opticratic culture, an opticratic civilization, an opticratic species? (No, opticratics is the way of life itself, thrust in competitive environs...) First we must ground ourselves in the obvious: that, as we are “in charge of representing ourselves” to others, both in action and in word, we are always interested parties in a social exchange of asymmetrical information. Many of our claims are phenomenological or personal-historical—in a word, unverifiable. "I'm tired"; "I like your dress"; "Bernard Shaw? Yes, I've read a bit of his work." And we are constantly choosing between an array of self-presentations; we will _always_ choose, to the best of our knowledge, the more flattering dress (or, in another context, the more professionally credible, etc.) over the unflattering one. We save our best clothing and jewelery for those occasions when we are most visible, or around the company we wish to impress most (“Sunday best”). A desire to dress up or show off for a romantic partner is considered a healthy sign for the relationship as it implies the demonstrative party still believes it’s worth putting in effort to put the best “impression”—the thoughts _about_ the demonstrative party in the observing party’s eyes, the content of his head. For a pure example, consider Adrienne Rich on cosmetics, in "Women and Honor: Some Notes on Lying":

> We have expected to lie with our bodies: to bleach, redden, unkink or curl our hair, to pluck eyebrows, shave armpits, wear padding in various places or lace ourselves, take little steps, glaze finger and toe nails, wear clothes that emphasized our helplessness.^[Where does this behavior come from? I would argue that these maneuvers are not enforced, top-down, rather that the advantages appearance bestows creates an incentive that kicks off an arms race.]

This aspect of opticracy is rather obvious, as we engage in it constantly. Somewhat more subtle are our unceasing avoidances. We can imagine a conversation with a friend, stranger, manager, performance evaluator, hiring board, first date, potential business partner, or even a long-term, serious romantic partner. (The effect is exacerbated during stranger interactions, but exists even in intimacy.) Conscious (i.e. discernible to the self) and legible (i.e. discernible to others) efforts in the direction of self-promotion may occasionally occur—shots at the basket, seized point-scoring opportunities with bounds on indulgence of claim. But our self-protective efforts—mentally projecting down decision trees, simulating possibilities, avoiding self-bruisings—are unending. Social interactions that do not have this character are the exception, and many arenas which attempt to break this pattern—such as therapy, where the explicit goal is ostensibly self-honesty^[Note too that such a space takes much of its power from its unique relation to truth.]—are characterized by reports from patients that they struggle constantly between honest and optimized self-presentation.

The linguistic utterance is just a subcategory of presentation more generally; social desire and expectation, and our place within it—in a word, reputation, "how I appear and am known to others"—is as constant in shaping our actions, in limiting the possible and desirable, as the laws of physics are to our bodily integrity.  Major life decisions are circumscribed by convention and justifiability. The ability to justify is the ability to still appear morally upright, or intelligent, or loyal, despite a decision which may testify (may appear) to the contrary. Perhaps the most significant factor in accepting a position is prestige—how valued it appears to others—both of employer and role; the next most significant is money, which is no stranger to impressing others. Justifiability is the leash which limits our range of motion: perhaps I cannot take tomorrow off work, because I cannot _justify_ it to my manager, but if my grandmother is to become very sick, suddenly I can. What if I were to _appear_ justified, to deceive? Recently it has come out that President Obama ended a very serious romantic relationship with an Asian-American woman, because it would have undermined his identity as a black politician, and thus shuttered his political future. He could not _justify_ the relationship, even as it meant everything to him.

And so appearance shapes our macro decisions just as it leads us to iron shirts or comb our hair. 

# Emulation and cargocult

Another facet of the opticratic idea is the observation that humans are a mimetic species, in the strict observational learning sense by which the procedural and ritualistic "imitation" is distinct from the goal-oriented "emulation." There is a certain level of surface mimicry that can occur separate from pragmatic functionality, leading to [[cargocult]] behavior.  Insofar as in many domains, it is difficult to trace causality or monitor outcomes, evaluation is similarly only possible based on adherance to the ritual procedures, further incentivizing optics-driven procedural fidelity over first-principles approaches. Of course, there is some basis for preferring the high-fidelity mimetic approach: In situations of complexity, culturally evolved and tested solutions will regularly outperform those designed from scratch. But at the same time, and in a world where rapid change has disrupted and eliminated many of the necessary environmental factors that made such solutions work, we can also become mired in their failings.

## Opticratics and positive feedback loops

Mary Jackalope: "When people are thin slicing you, you need to optimize for the thin slice that they get to take." To say that society is opticratic is not merely to say that individuals both judge based on, and actively fabricate, representations. It's also to say that they optimize toward representations, putting asymmetrical time and energy into publicly visible achievements. It is to say that there are positive feedback loops of prestige and image, where individuals make judgments predicated on (their impression of) other individuals' judgments, which can be kickstarted by the appropriate myths. Individuals predicate their behavior, and perceptions, on others' perceptions (see e.g. the famous Asch conformity experiments, in which confederates strongly affected the assessments of experimental subjects w/r/t the length of various reference lines). Thus, by manufacturing an appearance of popularity, success, or positive reputation, one can, [[magic|hyperstitionally]], bring this appearance to life: 

> In 1995, management gurus Michael Treacy and Fred Wiersema secretly purchased 50,000 copies of their business strategy book _The Discipline of Market Leaders_ from stores across the nation. The stores they purchased from just happened to be the ones whose sales are monitored to select books from the _New York Times_ bestseller list. Despite mediocre reviews, their book made the bestseller list. Subsequently, the book sold well enough to continue as a bestseller without further demand intervention by the authors. (Bikhchandani, Hirschleifer, Welch 1998: "Learning from the Behavior of Others")

Bikchandani et al note that "There is a word, 'claque,' for those hired to applaud loudly (or to heckle competitors) at musical and stage performances. Ancient Roman families hired professional mourners at funerals. Hennessy Cognac hired actors and models to order their product at fashionable bistros."

## vs deception

> If there is a lot of deceit, as in human communication, the only way you can counter the deceit, is by being very good at detecting it, and then of course you have to be very good at delivering it. Put those two things together as processes that go on for thousands of generations, and you wind up with a very complicated system of communication, complicated because of the deceit. What you really have to study is honest communication; that becomes the difficult thing to explain, which is sort of counter to our own views of ourselves, which makes it even more difficult.^[Richard Alexander in interview, 1996.]

Some, like the evolutionary biologist Richard Alexander, have called behavior like this, roughly, "deceptive communication." I consider this a sub-ideal conceptual grouping. It is not quite encompassing enough. It misses the ways in which humans do not merely _deceive_ but do in fact constantly modulate their behavior on the basis of social perceptions: choosing careers or life partners in part for others' positive impressions. To call this "deceiving others about your desires" feels inadequate to describe this; it bends over backwards only to see the situation upside down, as if a lifetime in finance were performed in order to "deceive" the neighbors that his true passion were not, indeed, sales. The concept of public relations, and the informational inevitability they exploit, suits us far better—in addition to not relying, as the deception frame does, on a tricky epistemic concept like "lie"—but instead can be defined consequentially, as any activity in the service of improving others' impression of oneself.

## The grammar of reading and writing appearances

Many media theorists have argued that our culture has become increasingly obsessed with image and appearance with the advent of television. Whether or not this is true, it is inescapable that the core dynamics of, first, judgment by appearances, and second, the resulting strategic optimization of appearances, transcend not just the 20th century but the human species. (See the characteristics of honor societies, and their valuation of reputation.) Any situation of partial information and selfish, competitive agents ends up this way—criteria which describe life as we know it. I have said earlier that we are an opticratic civilization, but that is not true either—life itself is opticratic; the property is fundamental. Not just at the philosophical level^[See the Kantian separation between phenomena—the world of appearances—and noumena—the world in itself.], in which reality "as it is" is ultimately inaccessible, or the sensory level, in which we occupy only an umwelt. But at the level of partial access to strategically information, which always opens the door to misinforming. In the worlds of animal mimicry and signaling, optics too reign supreme. The observing predator, or same-species rival, cannot know its adversary's strength short of actually engaging it. It must make a decision based on appearances, and appearances of vulnerability will lead even the strong to be constantly assailed (at high cost!) while appearances of strength can lead to protection of the weak.

The basic grammar of an interaction between two agents, human or not, is this. Each agent has goals. Each agent's goals are (if they are interacting) in some way affected by the behavior of the other agent. For instance, Adam and Bernard are colleagues in the office; Adam does not want Bernard to punch him out mid-conversation, which lead him to avoid offending Bernard too deeply, but he may also want to extract valuable information from Bernard about the company's stock prospects, while avoiding being late to his twelve-o'clock meeting, etc etc—interaction is shaped by dozens if not hundreds of simultaneous goals, many of which—like not getting into a physical altercation—are not consciously triaged but are "built in" to the structure of interaction.

Each agent creates information—"writes" an impression—which the other agent interprets, or "reads." These assessments are the foundation on which agents choose to act in light of their goals; if they believe that the situation they are in will threaten their goals, unless they take X course of action, they are likely to act in X way. If Bernard is beginning to get heated or pushy, or appears ready to launch into a much longer conversation than Adam can afford, Adam may de-escalate _under the theory_ that Bernard is about to embark on actions which will hamper his goals. He will do this pre-emptively, based on cues, which he metonymically interprets as pointing to some larger psychology, to Bernard's goals in general, or even just to Bernard's future action. The metonyms are found in the immediate interaction, but their metonymic "meaning"—the larger idea they point to—comes from Adam's life experience, which builds up a schema that he deploys to interpret his environment at all waking moments.

In short: Because 1) agents' actions are hampered or helped by other agents' actions, and 2) agents' actions are informed by their assessment of the situation, an assessment which is frequently predicated in part on other agents' representations, then 3) a given agent has a vested interest in producing representations which manipulate other agents into furthering his goals.

In particular, when "writing" a scene, individuals are incentivized to express or demonstrate cues which metonymically "signify" in a strategically advantageous way for the "read" individual, and since many interactions are implicitly positive selection processes—decisions about whether to form alliances, become friends or lovers, collaborate professionally together, on-board a new employee, accept a new students, give out grant money, etc—it is typically strategic for the "writing" party to create a favorable impression for the "reading" party. (See, for an opposing example where negative selection is more desirable, draft dodging, and individuals' attempts to secure medical, religious, or ethical exemptions.)

Crucially, self-compliments, or self-descriptions that are explicitly status-raising, aren't recognized as authoritative by receiving parties; rather, only peer judgments to these traits are. This norm is in itself a tacit admission of our opticratic games: we do not trust individuals to be neutral in matters of self-representation.

## Bureaucracy and surrogation

Institutions and persons in control of dispensing power and recognition, top-down, _as well as and especially_ non-expert lay-masses bottom-up, have an exceptionally partial window ("thin-slicing") on the full being-in-the-world of their subject of scrutiny—say, the public with a politician, or a hiring board with a job applicant. They are pressed on time and cannot jump out of their subjectivity; they are innately lazy because they are human. What are they to do? Systems of heuristics and proxies are established, and the divergence between proxy measure and proxied value is relentlessly exploited. Claims cannot  be verified; information is incomplete; motives are unknown. 

Metrics are frequently set up to objectify the process, which serves several goals at once. It legibilizes decision-making, allowing both transparency and critical deniability to those the individual or institution in question, be it a company to the public, an executive to a board, or an employee to a boss. It limits the possible damage of individual bias, or the pettiness of managers, or the too-hastily promoted, all of which is good for bureaucratic expansion and by extension, territorial colonization. Those turned away on the basis of metrics are more compliant, less combative—there has been a performance of science, and moreover, it increases the feeling of fairness through the obfuscation or flat-denial of human subjectivity.

These metrics are a process of legibilization; as such they can lay [[plausibility|plausible]] claim to justified purpose: increasing transparency, reducing the role of personal feeling in a superorganism’s decisions, logging a quick-to-view-and-process institutional history (“year-over-year returns”). But each of these benefits can equally be framed as a drawback: increasing surveillance, dehumanizing superorganisms, overwriting the past.

Moreover, the same systems of incentives that encourage institutionally beneficial behavior _also_ discourage accurate informational relay, sabotaging the institution. At first this may seem like a paradox, but it is perfectly consistent. Bureaucracies are permeated by _distant management_, that is, the management by non-experts, often from afar, of those below them, in a series of hierarchical layers heading up, such that, once the information passed up has been many-times massaged by each successive image-honing official, it is unreliable, defeating the purpose of information transfer, which is the proper, dynamic response to changing situations on the ground and to evidence of the efficacy of past initiatives. But if initiatives are not working properly, and bureaucrats are disincentivized from passing this information up (as poor performance affects their performance review and hence future at the institution), dynamic response is impossible. 

## Today's payoffs, tomorrow's symbolic performances

Actors in an opticratic landscape are constantly watchful as to the significance of—which is to say, the structure of payoffs accorded to—different actions, cues, and appearances. Since most of humans' games are fundamentally social, humans' assessments today deeply structure the kinds of optimizations that will be implemented or evaluated tomorrow. This dynamic, of course, gives rise to fads:

> [Haitians have the mindset that] getting more medicine of any type is always a good thing and will make them healthier, and doctors are these strange heartless people who will prevent them from taking a stomach medication just because maybe they don’t have a stomach problem at this exact moment. As a result, they lie like heck. I didn’t realize exactly how much they were lying until I heard the story, now a legend at our clinic, of the man who came in complaining of vaginal discharge. He had heard some woman come in complaining of vaginal discharge and get lots of medication for it, so he figured he should try his luck with the same. And this wasn’t an isolated incident, either. Complaints will go in “fads,” so that if a guy comes in complaining of ear pain and gets lots of medicine, on his way out he’ll mention it to the other patients in line and they’ll all mention ear pain too—or so the translators and veteran staff have told me.

This does not merely happen in Haiti, or the third-world, among the uneducated; it also is characteristic of our legal system. Nightjack, the anonymous police blog which won the Orwell Prize in 2009, writes in his April 27 2008 entry, "Goalposts Moving":

![[Nightjack#April 27 2008 Goalposts Moving]]

As fads emerge, evaluators catch on and begin devaluing the faddish cue, since it is being widely free-ridden by those who lack the qualities it implies (but wish to appear as if they possess them). We can see this in job applications, college admissions, and ADHD prescription requests—individuals looking to pass the requisite selection test spread word of successful entrance strategies. Inevitably, the [[treadmill|Red Queen]] has her way; the newly found "solution" no longer works, and a new "passcode" to the selection gate must be found. There is a "metonym [[treadmill]]" by which players are constantly seeking metonyms to gain entry, and gatekeepers are constantly seeking to keep their metonymic interpretations accurate, to prevent their being "hacked."

## Gamification and surrogation

C. Thi Nguyen, in his book _Games and the Art of Agency_, describes the “gamification” of modern life, where “simple and quantitative” game-like indicators replace our naturally “rich” and “subtle” values:

> A university administrator steps into the job for the sake of promoting student learning, but comes, over time, to instead be primarily motivated by increasing the school’s standing in the _US News and World Report _college ranking. Students goes [sic] to school for the sake of gaining knowledge, and come out focused on maximizing their GPA. Politicians go into politics for the sake of helping the people of their nations, and come to be focused on their standing in the various UN indices.

No doubt these effects are real, but it strikes me that Nguyen misses the larger picture. For one, the general “game” of these systems and positions has remained the same, even as we have added quantification. The values of politicians and administrators were not previously “rich” and “subtle” and only now corroded; rather, optimization for appearance has _always_ ruled life, and only recently has it become quantified; while it is plausible this quantification has worsened the situation, we cannot overstate the fall as if from some edenic holism of times past. 

Second and more important is the dynamic of _selection_ which takes place in our society on the basis of appearance. This preferential, opticratic selection, after all, is the underlying reason for actors’ optimization of appearances; if it were not the basis for selection, it would not motivate. All else equal, and indeed in practice, despite much else _unequal_, it will be the agent who pursues the advancement of his appearance _at the cost of all else_ who will end up systemically rewarded, since winning the game of appearances is definitional to such reward. A police organization in which corrupt players rise to the top more easily, by stat-padding or neglecting real ethical duties for the sake of reputation, is an organization which will disproportionately raise soft corruption to the top of the ladder. From the top it will be perpetuated: those who are corrupt can play ball with other corrupt staffers, but have their careers actively jeopardized by honesty; thus, once corruption is entrenched at the top, in positions of _selecting replacements_ and filling out ranks, it is very hard to overwrite. (Nor have the initial selection effects changed even if such cultural changes were more possible.)

## Opticratics in academia

We can start by examining some of the language and discourse surrounding “opticmization” in popular culture. From the _New York Times_, 2012:

> Any love-hate relationship must have its share of pain, so the academic world, in its obsession with college rankings, is suitably dismayed by news that an elite college, Claremont McKenna, fudged its numbers in an apparent bid to climb the charts. Dismayed, but not quite surprised. In fact, several colleges in recent years have been caught gaming the system — in particular, the avidly watched U.S. News & World Report rankings — by twisting the meanings of rules, cherry-picking data or just lying.

In addition to enriching our deceptive vocabulary—_fudging_, _twisting_, _cherry-picking_—we see Goodhart’s Law in action: once a measure has been established as a proxy for a quality, it is optimized for specifically and thus decreases in usefulness as a measure. We can also trust that schools which have been caught have been caught precisely for manipulating _verifiable, falsifiable_ information, a practice which, to other cons, no doubt appears sloppy. The egregious few are an indicator of a more pervasive practice. The ethical out, for those fudging, is likely the justification that as the existence of the rankings are themselves _already_ misleading or unjust, either insofar as they simplify the situation unjustly or else are permeated by soft corruption such that corruption is the only way to keep up, that such interventions are “righting” corrections to a scale already askew. “Yield games,” for instance, are strategies by universities to attract less-than-qualified applicants to apply, thus driving down their admission rate and appearing more selective (and thus, via proxy, higher quality and more prestigious). _To be seen as elite is to be elite_. To encourage additional applicants is, on one hand, very different from statistically fudging numbers to appear higher than reality—and on the other hand, it accomplishes the same end, with the additional waste of human time and labor on the part of those who fruitlessly apply. (In other words, it is arguably more harmful even as it resists easy identification by outsiders as opticmization.)

Lest future readers, lacking casual familiarity with the affairs of contemporary universities, not understand the reality of this pressure, we will quote from the _Times_ again:

> Bruce J. Poch, dean of admissions at Pomona until 2010, said of the rankings, “They’re not benign instruments,” but conceded that they are easy for a college to fall back on as evidence of its status. “The pressure is real,” he said. “God forbid you go down in those numbers.”

And lest we suspect that such fabrications are the result of character defect, rather than uniform institutional pressure:

> a senior officer had resigned after admitting that he had inflated the average SAT scores given to U.S. News since 2005... People briefed on the matter identified the officer as Richard C. Vos, vice president and dean of admissions... “He was always one of the people that I considered one of the good guys in the profession,” said Ralph Figueroa, director of college guidance at Albuquerque Academy, a private day school in New Mexico.

But opticratics goes far beyond admissions and into the actual research process. The psychologist Lee Jussim, interview with Yoel Inbar & Michael Inzlicht (2021):

> Success in our field... Academia and social science is fundamentally not a truth-seeking enterprise. It is a social evaluation seeking enterprise. You want approval from your colleagues. You need letters of recommendation to get into grad school, you need outside letters to get tenure and promotions, grant panels are evaluations, peer review are evaluations. None of this is objective reality, it's just everybody's opinions. Now, it's opinions that might be hinged to reality to some degree, but the prime mover is opinions.

## The eternality of opticratics

It is so difficult to say whether anything is new, whether the present differs from the past. We are a culture filled with nostalgia, and yet every culture we are nostalgic for _themselves _were nostalgic for a time before them. In Raymond Williams’s _The City and the Country_, he backdates pastoral nostalgia for decades, each generation believing the English countryside had been lost. Eras we now consider pinnacles of civilization: Classical Athens, Renaissance Italy, early Modernist Europe, were themselves filled with a bitter feeling of loss. They had uniquely inherited a fucked world, the real action just preceding them.

Likely we have always been opticratic. Whether it is as pronounced, whether institutionality and metrics and distributed networks and global communities united by the web have fundamentally altered the calculus, brought about a hyperopticratic era or just a new instantiation of an eternal state, is hard to say. Right now, reputations spread like wildfire, the currency of appearances trickles down from top to bottom; capital is picked up merely by knowing someone who knows someone, by being in the presence of power. Fiction gives us some of our best insight into this process; in Franzen’s _Freedom_, Walter Berglund talks bitterly about the culture of power in D.C.:

> In Washington people literally talk about how many feet away from John Kerry’s house their own house is. The neighborhoods are all so blah, the only thing that turns people on is proximity to power. It’s a total [[fetish]] culture. People get this kind of orgasmic shiver when they tell you they sat next to Paul Wolfowitz at a conference or got invited to Grover Norquist’s breakfast. Everybody’s obsessing 24/7, trying to position themselves in relationship to power.

The joke, in _Freedom_, is that this dynamic permeates human living; is not unique to D.C., or power, but applies to any kind of capital. Young women vie for proximity to the punk frontman Richard Katz and the cachet of cultural capital he carries; “even worse was Walter’s suspicion... that he was at root no different from any of those girls: that he, too, was a kind of parasite on Richard.” Guilt operates similarly, with tainting and trickling, syllogistic treatment and regard. The only way to enforce reputation’s punishments—isolation, expulsion, ostracization—is, after all, to threaten with punishment those who associate. (Those who do not enforce social decrees of reputation are called “second-order defectors” in [[game theory]].) Reputations taint those in their network; this has historically been considered a part of honor culture; guilt ran in bloodlines; and yet here we are. "Desire" is the gods these characters worship—premised not in hedonism but the belief in an essential, actualizing self—and yet that desire is premised on glistening surfaces and social reflexivity.

Zadie Smith’s 2018 short, “Now More Than Ever,” opens with the lines: “There is an urge to be good. To be seen to be good. To be seen. Also to be. Badness, invisibility, things as they are in reality as opposed to things as they seem, death itself—these are out of fashion.” It closes with the protagonist—a professor of philosophy, we gather—encountering an old friend, perhaps an ex-colleague who has been let go from the department for transgressive behavior:

> I bumped into someone on Bleecker who was beyond the pale. I felt like talking to him so I did. As we talked I kept thinking, _But you’re beyond the pale_, yet instead of that stopping us from talking we started to talk more and more frantically, babbling like a couple of maniacs about a whole load of things: shame, ruin, public humiliation, the destruction of reputation—that immortal part of oneself—the contempt of one’s wife, one’s children, one’s colleagues, personal pathology, exposure, suicidal ideation, and all that jazz. I thought, Maybe if I am one day totally and finally placed beyond the pale, I, too, might feel curiously free. Of expectation. Of the opinions of others. Of a lot of things. “It’s like prison,” he said, not uncheerfully. “You don’t see anybody and you get a lot of writing done.”

## Bullshit

Trivers’s work suggests (more accurately, awakes our sleeping knowledge of) the way humans appear to engage in embellishment far more often than in outright deception. In other words, we flatter our appearance—we make implications of our value, or evade admissions that might diminish others’ sense of us. A sizeable amount of the population does not merely straighten the couch and polish the silver but claim high achievement, invent misfortunes, and con dinner partners. (Business, pleasure; love, war.) In either case, those who are bad at it do it clumsily and are obvious. Those who are good at it create and maintain a entire webbing of curated qualities, of punctum which cohere.

There are a couple ostensible styles of deception in play. You could flinch at key moments, avoiding reveals you fear will cause injury to your image, in the other’s esteem. Since there is a psychological pattern, over time, patterned swatches of your life are are kept behind an iron curtain. They are seen by the other under no circumstance. Or you might be engaged in long-term self-deception, to buoy an ego, the old trope of the imbecilic branch manager, who gets baby-talked by summer interns, or is pitied by upper management (Arthur Miller). According to Trivers, we are all strafed by constant conflict between higher levels and lower levels of consciousness: our genes, our bodies, our subconscious might want something out of us that would be unbecoming to admit, might even thwart our intents, and the evolved strategy to ensure [[plausibility|plausible]] deniability is self-deception. Outright deception—premeditated, tactical, knowing—happens, but it doesn’t stuff up everyday sociality the way optics and (Trivers believes) our subconscious desires, a la Jungian shadow self, do. Most of the time it’s _bullshit_—or “claptrap” or “balderdash” etc. (Folk language is our vehicle for folk psychology’s insights.) 

Why might this be? We know the old adage, “To lie well, tell a near-truth” (in Pollan-speak, be mostly honest, with small parts altered). "I was doing a two-hour stakeout off Camino" the cop tells the wife, fresh off spending the hours with a side-piece who lives off—well, you know where. Less calculations for our protagonist if he gets asked details, or chooses to disclose them. Perhaps he gets credit for playing hero. Anyway, the facts mostly line up; reality microwaves verification for breakfast.

But it’s not merely computationally tractable; small alterations also facilitates [[Extend-and-Retreat]] communication strategies—what gets called in folk parlance “[[plausibility|plausible]] deniability.” 

> The immediate harm done by a successful lie direct—the deceitful generation of a false belief by concealed violation of the standard framework—can often be achieved more efficiently, and with less fear of detection or reprisal, by indirect means. One can intimate "the thing that is not" by implication, by significant silence, or even by the double bluff of pretending to lie while actually speaking the truth (as in the classical Minsk-Pinsk joke). (The annals of espionage are a rich source for this kind of deception.) Such maneuvers, a standard resource of advertising and diplomacy, are secure against the accusation of explicit and knowing mendacity: the offender can always plead that he didn't literally _say_ anything that he himself disbelieved.^[Black 1982]

Pinker’s already done the [[game theory]] here: if one wishes to get away with something, and the penalty for being caught is relatively high, hinting, the best (selfish) strategy is to hint, to use subtext in a way that evades confident interpretation (or legal culpability), but allows the receiver of the hint to issue a “confirmation” that he has both picked up, and is willing to discourse on the level of, the subtext^[Pinker, Nowak, Lee. The logic of indirect speech, 2008.]. You pick up girls the same way you bribe politicians or blackmail enemies. Similarly, we see extend-and-retreat underlying the motte-and-bailey rhetorical move, or the so-subtle-you’ll-miss-it bullying that teenage girls are known to excel at.

### Frankfurt: On Bullshit

Frankfurt's formulation of bullshit, and his distinction of bullshit from lying, is in my mind fundamentally flawed. Frankfurt premises this distinction on the idea that liars intentionally deceive, knowing they are creating a representation directly contrary to the truth, while bullshitters are uninterested in or unaware of the truth. Set aside that we can certainly generate abundant examples of behavior we (native speakers) would call "lying," in which the liar was unaware of the factual reality, or "bullshitting," in which the bullshitter _was_ aware of the factual reality. More important is that this entire epistemological distinction, of a kind with philosophy's absurd "knowledge" debates, is irrelevant to liars and bullshitters alike. Neither the liar nor the bullshitter are interested in the epistemological status of their claims so much as they care about improving their own situations, in making others think well of them or preventing others from thinking poorly of them. This, of course, is the same dynamic behind strategic omission and selective disclosure. Whether strategic omission "is" or "isn't" lying, whether it is separate or the same as bullshitting, is a vain semantic argument best left to the lexicographers in analytic philosophy. What matters is that all these cases share a fundamental dynamic of strategic self-representation. More important than the semantic argument over what is or isn't bullshit are questions like: What curtails our constantly exaggerating our accomplishments? How much of "honest" behavior is long-termist, and how much of it is the result of moral considerations and socialization? What is the leash that tethers us to the truth? How do we verify and cross-check information others provide us, in a way that keeps people surprisingly honest?Why do so many high-profile BS'ers produce such transparent BS, and how do they get away from it? (One is tempted to think that this is a selective, audience-scoped strategy: fooling a small minority may be worth the price of burning bridges with the disillusioned majority.) 

Black (1982)'s "The Prevalence of Humbug" may well be a better guide to opticratics than the over-cited, over-hyped Frankfurt. Humbug succeeds, Black writes, when "favorable impressions are created" in the receiving ("reading") party. It creates problems because it "tends progressively to adulerate speech and thought," though more accurate, perhaps, is to view linguistic cues as emerging, with some strength or accuracy, and being quickly free-ridden into the ground, diluted and inflated, battered into the ground.

We can swap "speech" in the following passage for "signals," to get at the broader set of self-representation and other-interpretation:

> A plausible justification of the prominence assigned to the vice of lying is suggested by a gloss of Montaigne's contention that as human beings "we... hold together only by speech." It is obvious that children could not learn to speak if they were reared only by adults who lied to them irresponsibly and at random. For in such an environment a child could not even learn the common names of familiar objects. Closely connected with this point is the familiar observation that the liar is parasitic on general, though not universal, veracity: lying, as a species of deceit, would be futile in the absence of general efforts to be truthful. It seems reasonable to conclude that a liar is, in a radical way, sapping the foundations of social institutions, all of which depend on the general effectiveness of speech. The liar is indeed an enemy of society, who tends to undermine all possibility of civilized intercourse. Universal lying would destroy intelligible speech.

This is the exact logic of mimicry, the free-riding of signals.

Frankfurt's essay is also, unfortunately, an example of [[conceptual analysis]] and its pitfalls. Against the Logicians 2014: What is wrong with academic philosophy today?

> Frankfurt ignores the subtle differences between the ways we use the word “bullshit” and related words. In fact, if I remember correctly, he assumes that these words must share an essential meaning, and then proceeds to define that meaning — bafflingly — not based on how we use the noun “bullshit,” but based on how we use the verb “bullshitting“…

## Weinstein on kayfabe

Eric Weinstein, despite—or perhaps because of—all his own self-aggrandizing, pompous bluster—has proven incisive in emphasizing "kayfabe" as an important theoretical concept for understanding human and institutional behavior.

"Kayfabe" is a concept from wrestling describing the careful choreography and performance of a fiction for an audience, and the complex way this fiction interacts with reality (acts on and is acted on, cybernetically and reflexively). Early in wrestling's history, it operated by a "catch" paradigm which was deadly for competitors. Many would be crippled for life early in their careers, and fights involved long periods of circling and waiting punctured by the high-risk grappling, as competitors would seek to avoid and minimize risk. Kayfabe emerges out of this dilemma, and helps transition wrestling from a "real" sport to a performance:

"Kayfabrication," Weinstein writes, "arises out of attempts to deliver a dependably engaging product for a mass audience while removing the unpredictable upheavals that imperil participants." In other words, it is an insurance policy, a way of keeping audiences entertained or pleased while minimizing real risk to competitors. In war, for instance, it is well known that the overwhelming majority of fired rounds land nowhere near a target, and in some sense are not meant to: they are performances by soldiers for their higher-ups.

In wrestling, those who play the performance are known as "workers"; those whose sense of fantasy lapses into real sport and competition are known as "shooters," are treated with wariness, distance, or even social shame: there is an implicit acknowledgment that the "real" game is in the artifice, that to wrestle "for real" is not only to risk the game but to risk the safety of participants. This dynamic is mirrored in the bureaucratic structures of something like _[[_The Wire_]]_, where, in a fundamentally corrupt administration, non-corrupt players are "noncooperative" and dangerous, as they cannot be bought nor can they be relied on to co-fabricate the shared public-facing image that other players spend their attempt to build. (In other words, a [[surrogation]] of image for the actual—but of course, as the wrestling example shows, the line between the "artifice" and "actual" is not morally valenced on its own; rather, it is the _outcomes_ of different game modes which matters. To "shoot" in wrestling is to risk real lives from a personal sense of competition; to "shoot" in the The Wire's Baltimore police department is, perhaps, to risk other officials' careers, but also to improve the safety of the city, or to protect citizens' civil liberties from infringement.)

## Art and opticratics 

Art, especially in para-social forms like the novel, film, and theater, are some of our best modes of interrogating opticratics. Noë 2015: _Strange Tools_:

> Personhood is performed, I said above. This brings me to the second linked idea: that of performance. In one sense, “to perform” is simply the most general verb of action. We perform actions in the course of our lives. But it is also possible to distinguish between things we simply do and the actions that, in doing, we perform. It is a difficult exercise to figure out just what principle marks that line, but it has something to do with the fact that when we perform, as distinct merely from acting, we act in view of the evaluation or standards or rules and norms of others. We speak of sexual performance, performance on the job, athletic performance, performance at school, and, of course, performance on the stage. Whether you are actually subject to the evaluation of another—maybe you are practicing handstands in your room or making drawings for your eyes only—you are still performing, for what you do is open to the possible, if not the actual, assessment of others. And crucially, that’s how we experience it, too. The fact that you are alone rarely ever means you are truly alone, for almost everything we do is framed by the roles we are playing and the standards to which we are subject. Can you think of exceptions?
>
> Turning to art, we can now appreciate why it is that performance is, as in some sense it is, the most fundamental of all the arts. The performing artist makes these facts about our lives raw material for his or her own practice. We are fundamentally performers. Not as a matter of choice, and not as a matter of biology, but as an inescapable condition of being a person. A performing artist is one who places himself or herself on the stage and says, “Watch me do what I do,” all the while knowing that you are watching him or her do it.

## Bodybuilding

_See also full [[bodybuilding]] entry._

[[Sam Fussell]], son of Paul Fussell (author of _Class_) spent six years competitively body-building in Southern California in the late 80s. Again and again, his memoir of the time, _Muscle_, stresses how much [[bodybuilding]] is a matter of appearances and optics. Though bodybuilders are often assumed to build for health reasons, the opposite is true: building culture, from its body strain, to its steroid use, to its extreme pre-exhibition cutting diets, is often dangerously unhealthy. At some point in the book, a fellow builder tells Sam, when he complains about how unhealthy his lifestyle has become: "Big Man, this is about looking good, not feeling good."

Builders' identity is predicated on their appearance. "If who you are is what you do, and as a bodybuilder, what you do is what you look like, then in California, I was distinctly in trouble," Fussell writes about the early stages of his career, "because I didn't look like a bodybuilder." Older, more experienced lifters end up taking him under their wing, teaching how to walk, talk, and behave like a builder—to put on a public show:

> Every word they uttered, every move they made seemed rehearsed—as rehearsed, in fact, as any performance I'd ever seen on stage. That explained the pregnant pauses before delivering the lines I knew so well from the magazines. Lines like "You gotta stay hungry," or "You work hard, good things will happen." Much of being a bodybuilder, I gathered, meant playing at being a bodybuilder.

The magazines sell only myths:

> My education began in distinguishing fact from fantasy. And the facts, once I was out in California, were staring me in the face. The bodybuilder listed at six two, was, in fact, five foot ten. His arms, listed at 22 inches, were, in fact, 20, etc, etc. The rabid heterosexual was, in fact, gay for pay. The ‘all-natural’ bodybuilder, in fact, was a walking advertisement for the pharmaceutical industry. Eye-openers, all. And infinitely depressing, because it meant, eventually, all you could believe in was iron – because iron does not lie. You can either lift it or you can’t.

And part of this myth involves outright fabrication:

> There’s a saying in the gym: “It’s not enough to learn to lift. You have to learn to lie.” In other words, if you want to make a living doing what you love (lifting), you have to lie about how you lift. In other words, a steroid-fed bodybuilder does not make his living talking about how he built his body with hard work, with learning to diet, and, crucially, with steroids.

# [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]]'s microsociology

[[Erving Goffman|Goffman]]'s work on expression games, facework, the "front" vs "backstage behaviour," etc is the clearest precursor of opticratics. Film critic Henry Taylor on [[David Mamet]]'s [[_House of Games_]]:

> Akin to [[Erving Goffman]]'s "presentation of self in everyday life" and the playing of roles in social behaviour, of theatrical conceptions of symbolic interaction in reality, Mamet's cinema draws attention to dramaturgical concepts such as proposed by [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] in his distinction between storefront and backstage behaviour; on the backstage, however, we do not encounter undisguised, "true reality," but only further game-playing. In the context of [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]]'s theorization of "strategic interaction," focusing on espionage and secret agents, and of the frame to analyse different spheres and boundaries of game-like human interaction, it would seem that Mamet's films not only lend multiple, fertile meanings to these concepts, but also to illustrate a creative and productive symbiosis of theatre and cinema. His theatrical cinema, non-realist both in the conception of acting as reflexive performance and of narrative filmmaking based on a formalist theory of montage—the "juxtaposition of uninflected images"—not only self-consciously highlights social role-playing, but envisions human interaction as strategic interaction in a world of simulation and dissimulation, reality as consisting of game-play on various orders. In this, his approach aligns with postmodernism's view of reality as a series of games being played, there being ultimately no accessible reality outside of these games: even death as a liminal event, as House of Games suggests, is not really available to us outside of the symbolic order. The theatricality of performance in Mamet is thus diegeticised into a filmic reality in which appearances are notoriously deceptive, and frames, cons, and double-crosses inform both the world his characters inhabit and, last but not least, the relationship of his films to the cinema audience. In this Chinese-box world of illusions, we seem to be perpetually stuck in Plato's cave.

# Cage's 4'33" 

_4'33"_ isn't interesting because it teaches us that "There's no such thing as silence." That's Cage's interpretation, and it's facile—that "the absence of musical notes" does not mean complete and utter quiet did not need proving, nor a demonstration. Besides, the "silent composition" gimmick wasn't even original—see Alphonse Allais's _Funeral March for the Obsequies of a Deaf Man_ (1897), or Erwin Schulhoff's _In Futurum_ (1919), or the end of Yves Klein's _Monotone-Silence Symphony_ (1949).

What's interesting about _4'33"_ is what happens to audiences, _as a result of the work's framing_. Not on the first performance, the much-talked about inaugural show to a naive audience at an Upstate artist colony's half-outdoor theater. But on those that follow. Once the piece is understood, by audiences who attend it, as being "about" the ambient sounds in the concert hall, a performance pressure inevitably enters. And there is no clear script for how to behave under the spotlight; many audience members may not even have realized, _until they are seated and the work has begun_, that they are performers; and now they do not know whether to stay perfectly silent or make noises. Nothing can be "natural" in this situation—one considers, self-consciously, shifting around in one's seat, or reaching for one's purse, or coughing. A scratch in the throat becomes a dilemma—for the anxious, a full-blown crisis. When the concert hall is too silent, nothing happens, the crowd yearns for an Event—who will supply it? But conscious, deliberate noises—making sounds instead of listening—is at the same time taboo, against the point of the piece, which desires a _lack_ of self-consciousness even as it creates, inevitably, its opposite—extreme self-consciousness. These two poles tear at the listener. They wish to _be_ authentic and to _appear_ authentic. The trouble is, those ends are frequently in conflict.

# Contemporary exacerbation

## TLP's narcissism

Many of the observations of opticratics align with TLP's concept of narcissism—the triumph of image over actuality. The problem is that by using the narcissism frame, TLP casts it as a neurosis. The problem is that neuroses are typically maladaptive, and opticsmization is, rather, a strategic approach. The problem is that external strategies become internal priorities, cf. "the mask if the face."

## Geoff Mak on art world
> Even the word Basel had become a code word for cultural excess, an adlib to fill in the “What happens at stays at” dictum, a pride festival for Northeast liberals, an excuse to use “art” as stand-ins for “social awareness” and “criticality” that, instead of reining in excess, otherwise affirms the 24-hour hedonism of coke and neon. If politics is downstream from culture, then here was the culture: cultish, narcissistic, obsessed with petty optics over a coherent ideology, and eternally paranoid about minor distinctions up and down the social caste system.

# Dissimulation

Dissimulation: the concealment of one's beliefs, thoughts, motives... hiding under false appearances. (See "lexical hypothesis")

# McLuhan, "The Medium is the Massage"

# Philosophical precedent

Hume's "sensible knave" is one who will deviate from honesty when it is advantageous. Hume is responding to Glaucon's challenge, in Plato's _Republic_, and the story of Gyges and his invisibility ring, which allows him to commit immoral acts without consequence. Plato believes that an immoral life leads to less happiness than a moral one, and thus Gyges is not acting rationally. Hume believes the sensible knave is rational but odious.

Nietzsche on Odysseus, in _Daybreak_:

> Greek ideal.  What did the Greeks admire in Odysseus? Above all, his capacity for lying, and for cunning and terrible retribution; his being equal to contingencies; when need be, appearing nobler than the noblest; the ability to be whatever he chose; heroic perseverence; having all means at his command; possession of intellect  his intellect is the admiration of the gods, they smile when they think of it  : all this is the Greek ideal! The most remarkable thing about it is that the antithesis of appearance and being is not felt at all and is thus of no significance morally. Have there ever been such consummate actors!

And from "Truth & Lies in a Non-Moral Sense," Nietzsche gives a post-Darwinian argument for dishonesty:

> As a means for the preserving of the individual, the intellect unfolds its principle powers in dissimula-
tion, which is the means by which weaker, less robust individuals preserve themselves—since they have
been denied the chance to wage the battle for existence with horns or with the sharp teeth of beasts of
prey. This art of dissimulation reaches its peak in man. Deception, flattering, lying, deluding, talking be-
hind the back, putting up a false front, living in borrowed splendor, wearing a mask, hiding behind con-
vention, playing a role for others and for oneself—in short, a continuous fluttering around the solitary
flame of vanity—is so much the rule and the law among men that there is almost nothing which is less
comprehensible than how an honest and pure drive for truth could have arisen among them.

# [[_Moral Mazes_]]

_...reality dissolves into appearances and becomes chimerical. Notions of substance get lost in a welter of shadowy images, of staged events, of carefully arranged fronts._

Jackall argues that individuals in corporations work systematically to hide mistakes or weaknesses, and to promote a self-advancing image of themselves. This means that mistakes are systematically hidden, and the makers of mistakes are not selected out of the institution; rather, whoever is politically weakest and proximate to the issue is scapegoated.

From Jackall's interviews with managers:

> Persons who can present themselves well, who can sell themselves the best are the kind of people who get ahead. It’s an image type thing. Not just doing the job right but being able to capitalize on it in certain ways. Some people are gifted at doing that. They handle themselves very well. They may not be take-charge people but they give you the impression that they are. They dress properly and dress is very important.

> [Style] is being able to talk easily and make presentations. To become credible easily and quickly. You can advance quickly even without technical experience if you have style. You get a lot of points for style.

> Sales people and business people [are] constantly being exposed to management, making presentations to the Operating Committee. If they are articulate, well-dressed, articulate their program well, they make an indelible impression. I’ve seen many guys who on the basis of one presentation have been promoted beyond their abilities. And if they’re telling the top guys good news in the bargain, well, that just helps them. I’m always astonished by this emphasis on appearances. I mean . . . if they like the way you look, you have a good chance to impress them. . . .When the top guys see a guy and say: “Hey, he’s great,” the myth about the guy is perpetuated. If they say to a plant manager that some guy is great, the plant manager is not going to say that he can’t find his ass in a rainstorm. And suddenly the guy is on the fast track.

Jackall reflects:

> In a world where appearances—in the broadest sense—mean everything, the wise and ambitious manager learns to cultivate assiduously the proper, prescribed modes of appearing. He dispassionately takes stock of himself, treating himself as an object, as a commodity. He analyzes his strengths and weaknesses and decides what he needs to change in order to survive and flourish in his organization. And then he systematically undertakes a program to reconstruct his image, his publicly avowed attitudes or ideas, or whatever else in his selfpresentation that might need adjustment.

> Increasingly, the notion of “lean, hungry, and aggressive management” became the company watchword and the bonhomie of the old regime became dangerous. Wise and ambitious managers assessed the situation and altered their public faces to fit the new circumstances, the occasion, the circle, the need. Such adroit self-rationalization demands continual self-scrutiny, a constant private monitoring of one’s adaptation to socially defined criteria. One not only displays correct appearances, social finesse, and the proper attitudes but one always reflexively examines one’s performance, as if glancing in a mirror.

# Machiavelli: The Prince

> a prince ought, above all things, always endeavour in every action to gain for himself the reputation of being a great and remarkable man.

> ...it is unnecessary for a prince to have all the good qualities I have enumerated, but it is very necessary to appear to have them. And I shall dare to say this also, that to have them and always to observe them is injurious, and that to appear to have them is useful; to appear merciful, faithful, humane, religious, upright

## Distant vs. proximate evaluation

On distance-closeness, and the effect of proximateness, or intimacy, on better interpretation via additional information (see [[Evaluation Distance]] entry):

> ...a prince ought to take care that he never lets anything slip from his lips that is not replete with the above-named five qualities, that he may appear to him who sees and hears him altogether merciful, faithful, humane, upright, and religious. There is nothing more necessary to appear to have than this last quality, inasmuch as men judge generally more by the eye than by the hand, because it belongs to everybody to see you, to few to come in touch with you. Every one sees what you appear to be, few really know what you are, and those few dare not oppose themselves to the opinion of the many, who have the majesty of the state to defend them; and in the actions of all men, and especially of princes, which it is not prudent to challenge, one judges by the result. For that reason, let a prince have the credit of conquering and holding his state, the means will always be considered honest, and he will be praised by everybody; because the vulgar are always taken by what a thing seems to be and by what comes of it; and in the world there are only the vulgar, for the few find a place there only when the many have no ground to rest on.

_cf. discussion of "distant credentials" in [[hazardAndReason200508]]._

On our prejudice against waffling, equivocation, and decision-reversal (that is, our prejudice for [[commitment]] and consistency):

> It makes him contemptible to be considered fickle, frivolous, effeminate, mean-spirited, irresolute, from all of which a prince should guard himself as from a rock; and he should endeavour to show in his actions greatness, courage, gravity, and fortitude; and in his private dealings with his subjects let him show that his judgments are irrevocable, and maintain himself in such reputation that no one can hope either to deceive him or to get round him.

We can also theorize a kind of "common belief," similar to [[common knowledge]], except not knowledge insofar as it is not actually (or necessarily) true. This common belief is part of preference-falsification regimes, and can also prevent conspiracy against the government:

> That prince is highly esteemed who conveys this impression of himself, and he who is highly esteemed is not easily conspired against; for, provided it is well known that he is an excellent man and revered by his people, he can only be attacked with difficulty.

# Gioia 2002, "Being Good Versus Looking Good: Business School Rankings and the Circean Transformation From Substance to Image"

Much of image's power comes because it serves as a Schelling point—even when individuals recognize that image is not the full story, or that a high-prestige selection may not align with their more pragmatic and personal interests, successful images remain attractive for focal point reasons.

Chains of images—where reputation in one domain assists entry into a further reputation-building program—leads to a "paper chase":

> [Rankings] turn the pursuit of the MBA into a paper chase, wherein the only thing that matters is the degree itself. Prospective MBAs don't necessarily care to learn everything that a quality MBA program teachers. They want entre into influential business networks. They know that those networks germinate and flourish in top-ranked MBA programs, regardless of the actual quality of those programs or their suitability for a given student's 

This paper chase encourages all participating members of an institution to act as public advocates on behalf of their institution's status or prestige, since this institutional reputation affects their own value on the job market, dating market, etc (see Argenti 2000, "Branding b-schools: reputation management for business schools").

# Optical allyship

Traldi:
> The critique of “virtue signaling” is associated with the political center and right, although it’s sometimes taken up on the left as well, where it goes by stranger names like “optical allyship” (saying that phrase is in itself a bit of a signal!). The idea is that political progressives’ interest in _seeming_ good does not always help, and sometimes hinders, any genuine interest they might have in _doing_ the right thing.

# Footnotes
[^1] Potemkin villages are those, according to legend, constructed by Gregory Potemkin in order to impress Russia's Empress Catherine II—all gorgeous facade without backing. In some renditions of the story, these facades were removed, once Catherine had passed, and quickly transported to a point further along her path, where they were reused as if a new structure. Similar cases abound in the Cold War, and in North Korean relations with the Western world. One infamous story regarding Boris Yeltsin tells that, when he visited Texas in the 1980s, he believed the abundance of food in American supermarkets was potemkin, and, disbelieving, demanded to be driven to scattered supermarkets in other areas of the state to confirm their veracity.
