JL Austin: “There’s the bit where you say it, and the bit where you take it back.”

Ibn Kalduhn, _Muqaddimah_:

> Whenever contemporaries speak about the dynastic armies of their own or recent times, and whenever they engage in discussions about Muslim or Christian soldiers, or when they get to figuring the tax revenues and the money spent by the government, the outlays of extravagant spenders, and the goods that rich and prosperous men have in stock, they are quite generally found to exaggerate, to go beyond the bounds of the ordinary, and to succumb to the temptation of sensationalism. When the officials in charge are questioned about their armies, when the goods and assets of wealthy people are assessed, and when the outlays of extravagant spenders are looked at in ordinary light, the figures will be found to amount to a tenth of what those people have said.

A rhetorical cousin of equivocation.

## Motte and Baileys

Rorty, Consequences of Pragmatism:

> When dialectical philosophers are accused of idealism, they usually reply as Berkeley replied to his critics—by explaining that they are only protesting against the errors of a certain philosophical school and that they are really not saying anything at which the plain man would demur. As Austin said in this connection, "There's the bit where you say it and the bit where you take it back."

### Schackel: The Vacuity of Postmodern Methodology

> A Motte and Bailey castle is a medieval system of defence in which a stone tower on amound (the Motte) is surrounded by an area of land (the Bailey) which in turn isencompassed by some sort of a barrier such as a ditch. Being dark and dank, the Motte isnot a habitation of choice. The only reason for its existence is the desirability of theBailey, which the combination of the Motte and ditch makes relatively easy to retaindespite attack by marauders. When only lightly pressed, the ditch makes small numbers ofattackers easy to defeat as they struggle across it: when heavily pressed the ditch is notdefensible and so neither is the Bailey. Rather one retreats to the insalubrious butdefensible, perhaps impregnable, Motte. Eventually the marauders give up, when one iswell placed to reoccupy desirable land.For my purposes the desirable but only lightly defensible territory of the Motte andBailey castle, that is to say, the Bailey, represents a philosophical doctrine or positionwith similar properties: desirable to its proponent but only lightly defensible

## John Holbo 2007: Crooked Timber blog post

> Jonah Goldberg is now grumbling that people are calling him stupid. But, to be fair, the upshot of Goldberg’s indignant response to Henry’s post would seem to be that Henry was actually too charitable to Goldberg’s original post. But I’m getting ahead of my story. Goldberg complains: “Any fair reader of my post (hint, that excludes Henry) would see that I was criticizing liberals and conservatives for not taking culture into account enough.” Now what would that too low accounting value be? “My point was not that culture is everything, but that government isn’t everything.” That is, Goldberg is claiming that the assignment of a non-zero significance to culture is bold contrarianism that places him at odds with both left and right. Of course, far from being a bold position, the claim that culture is not nothing is something everyone would grant freely, if it seemed to anyone worth mentioning.

> To put it another way, **Goldberg is making a standard rhetorical move which has no accepted name, but which really needs one. I call it ‘the two-step of terrific triviality’. Say something that is ambiguous between something so strong it is absurd and so weak that it would be absurd even to mention it. When attacked, hop from foot to foot as necessary, keeping a serious expression on your face.** With luck, you will be able to generate the mistaken impression that you haven’t been knocked flat, by rights. As a result, the thing that you said which was absurdly strong will appear to have some obscure grain of truth in it. Even though you have provided no reason to think so.

## Insinuation and coordinated equilibrium-switching

See Liz Camp 2018 on insinuation—the advancing of an implicature specifically with the purpose of having plausible deniability if facing opposition.

One of the problems of tacit coordination is getting stuck in inefficient or Pareto-dominated equilibria. Players who switch off the equilibria in search of a more efficient one will, by definition, lose utility in the short term, even if they recover it in the long term. Synchronous switching to a new equilibrium is thus strategically ideal.

Consider Pinker, Lee, & Nowak's work on innuendo and indirect speech. A speaker, X, hints in a way that is plausibly deniable, or at the very least, that interlocutor Y can choose to ignore (can "do being ordinary"; see [[strategic interaction]]) or affirm, depending on whether he, too, wishes to switch to a new equilibrium. This is explored briefly in Vollmer 2013's "What kind of game is everyday interaction?":

> In utilizing correlation devices, players can avoid Pareto-dominated equilibria in tacit coordination to the extent to which they are able to shift their expectations simultaneously to preferred coordination equilibria.

## Dan Dennett, "Deepities"

> A deepity (a term coined by the daughter of my late friend, computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum) is a proposition that seems both important and true - and profound - but that achieves this effect by being ambiguous. On one reading, it is manifestly false, but it would be earth-shaking if it were true; on the other reading, it is true but trivial. The unwary listener picks up the glimmer of truth from the second reading, and the devastating importance from the first reading, and thinks, Wow! That's a deepity.

> Here is an example (better sit down: this is heavy stuff): Love is just a word.

> Oh wow! Cosmic. Mind-blowing, right? Wrong. On one reading, it is manifestly false. I'm not sure what love is – maybe an emotion or emotional attachment, maybe an interpersonal relationship, maybe the highest state a human mind can achieve – but we all know it isn't a word. You can't find love in the dictionary!

> We can bring out the other reading by availing ourselves of a convention philosophers care mightily about: when we talk about a word, we put it in quotation marks, thus: "love" is just a word. "Cheeseburger" is just a word. "Word" is just a word. But this isn't fair, you say. Whoever said that love is just a word meant something else, surely. No doubt, but they didn't say it.

What Dennett doesn't add is that these phrases _can_ be justified insofar as they are a sort of rhetorical correction on a perceived-as-dominant signal (see [[torque epistemology]] entry). It is *just* a word, where the overstatement leans heavy on the assumed, contextual belief. This context, of course, gets quickly lost. And the rhetorical lean is hard to distinguish, at a distance, from bad cartography.

### Perry: Meaning as Ambiguity

To Perry, unstable duality or ambivalence is one of if not the fundamental mechanisms for perceived "meaningness." It is the play between meanings, and the inability of the text to settle on any one, which gives the text felt charge.

> In order to understand [[ambiguity]], we must encounter the enemies of [[ambiguity]]: legibility and vagueness, which, surprisingly, often occur together.

> To me the empty tomb at the end of the Gospel of Mark is more ambiguous, hence more artistically and spiritually interesting, than the fan theories worked out in the other gospels, although these are also beautiful and ambiguous in their own ways.
