# Carl Wilson: Let's Talk About Love

> Ranking lastingness above novelty is a holdover from an aesthetic of scarcity, predating the age of mechanical or digital reproduction.

# Conversation with Ben Brown, October 2020

[9:14 AM] gary noumenon: y'know, periodically we talk about whether or not most great works of art are discovered or decay in obscurity
[9:15 AM] gary noumenon: and historically i've taken the optimistic side
[9:17 AM] gary noumenon: but recently, exploring this list of rabelais-influenced books by your boy steven moore, something occurred to me
[9:19 AM] gary noumenon: there are probably a dozen post-recognitions american novels of staggering erudition and wit that try desperately to be the recognitions, and no one cares about any of them
[9:19 AM] gary noumenon: and my theory is—this is because they suck.
[9:20 AM] gary noumenon: darconville's cat was ornately sarcastic and unreadably stupid
[9:21 AM] gary noumenon: sorrentino? wow, way to show how many artists are hypocrites and not possessed of true genius, that's never been done before
[9:23 AM] gary noumenon: maybe these are great works of art, and i'm just too impatient with the verbal whirligigs to get past 100 pages, but in that case i must amend my take on art preservation.
[9:23 AM] gary noumenon: most great works art are remembered: unless they try to imitate the recognitions.
[9:26 AM] gary noumenon: and the reason for that is basically what berger says: an archive of hot takes does not stand the test of time
[9:28 AM] gary noumenon: BUT—BUT—the recognitions is not this, which is why it is still remembered.
[9:34 AM] gary noumenon: the recognitions is nonpareil because it expresses something humanly true in spite of all its erudition and wit. unlike most of its imitators, it's not apophatic, there is a True Path that at least one character achieves (also true of infinite jest, but not gravity's rainbow), and indeed, part of that path is "you probably shouldn't write a novel like the recognitions, unless you really really want to."
[9:42 AM] gary noumenon: ultimately the prescription probably boils down to "love, and do what thou wilt," which is not an original take, but wisdom isn't supposed to be: and once you offer a take, not about society, but to society (i.e. the reader), you're no longer an encylopedia.
