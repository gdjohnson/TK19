Things typically attributed to conspiracy are more frequently the result of tacit selection. Editors do not mandate, top-down, the political slants of their network; they shape it through bottom-up filtration: decisions what stories to run, decisions who to hire. These decisions are in turn made predictively, with thought to the expected value, based on audience selection—the kinds of stories that are widely read and shared.

## The expert problem

One common bias concerns the consideration by experts of a [[fields|field]], as biased by the experts' self-selection into the field and this self-selection's role as a prerequisite for expertise. Experts in contemporary visual art will, almost as a rule, think quite highly of it—otherwise, they would believe themselves to be spending their lives dedicated to a worthless topic. Less controversial entries are in fact less neutral than more controversial ones: obscure Japanese anime fans are often very biased in favor of the topic, since all their editors have been fans.

We will call it the expert problem: the very simple observation that a field’s experts have less insight into the relevance and role of their discipline than do informed outsiders.

The expert problem is founded on several subproblems. One is the ease of exit problem: for the discipline who is quickly becoming disillusioned with a methodology of inquiry, it is much  prerequisite for expertise.simpler to exit the field than to fight the field. There will be very few dissidents after a regimen of graduate school: the cognitive dissonance and uphill battle of internal conflict is enough to select largely for true believers. Related to this is the self-selection problem: those who do not think the field’s methodology is legitimate or valuable in the first place will largely tend to avoid that field. Both of these problems are made worse by the high burden involved in becoming a member of the field’s discourse, which involves both hazing and credentials.

This alone would not be a problem except for the fact that “experts” in a field are treated as “experts in a field”: one cannot, for instance, level criticism against the artworld that “sticks,” because a prerequisite of launching such criticism is being already an insider:

> The “poem” under discussion is by art critic Robert Hughes—his writing for Time magazine, instead of a dedicated New York arts publication, is enough for Sischy to dismiss him as outsider. 

But we've picked on the artworld quite a bit; the truth is this mechanism is equally pernicious elsewhere. Poets believe poetry will change the world. Philosophers of religion are quite bullish on God, much less agnostic or atheistic than philosophers of other disciplines, but it would be strange to grant them authority on the matter. Similarly with metaphysicians, who of course as a group strongly believe that metaphysics is an important and legitimate inquiry. (Non-metaphysicians in philosophy are much less enthusiastic.) And of course, this applies for philosophy as a field: though almost every great philosopher has eventually concluded that the death of philosophy is called for, hopeful (or arrogant) yung’uns continue to swell the philosophical ranks. This is not to say that this enthusiasm is necessarily to anyone’s detriment, but that we cannot really trust philosophers to say whether their field is justified in the first place.

# Selection games

[[Oliver Wendell Holmes]]'s [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] prediction theory of law frames the law as a selection game in which criminals wish to stay out of prison.
