_See also [[Game Theory]] entry._

Some games, like [[chess]], or daytrading, involve intense internal competition with little productive value to the outside world.

From [[Sam Fussell]]'s _Muscle_:

> What would Jeremy Bentham, the father of [[utilitarianism]], think of [[bodybuilding]]? He had to be turning over in his grave. After all, the iron we lifted didn't help build a bridge or a battleship or a skyscraper. It enlarged our biceps and spread the sweep of our thights. The labor of farmers and factory workers and longshoremen had a kind of dignity and purpose that ours didn't.
