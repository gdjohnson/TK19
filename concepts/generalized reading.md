[[_Language in Thought and Action_]]:
> as Susanne K. Langer has said, "The symbol-making function is one of man's primary activities... It is the fundamental process of the mind, and goes on all the time." One may try to live a simple life with little concern for symbols of affluence, social status, and the like, but one soon discovers that the rejection of symbolism is itself symbolic. Wearing a necktie is symbolic, but not wearing a necktie is equally symbolic. Parents and children have had bitter quarrels in recent years over hair stylesâ€”long, short, spiked, shaved. Such quarrels are not really about hair but about the symbolic meanings involved in how hair is worn.

[5:51 PM] suspended reason: Thinking about cases when the cause of feeling "trapped" in a situation, or performing an action, is that taking a different action, or removing myself from the situation, will inevitably "write" a message to onlookers which is also costly
[5:53 PM] suspended reason: So, for instance, I am at The Kitchen, watching a terrible rendition of artworld stand-up comedy by a trans comic, her gender being relevant because it is a prerequisite to her being up on stage saying things which no other identity could pull off in her cultural milieu, and the jokes are terribly reductive, either misandry or shitty Marxism, and it is slated to last 90 minutes
[5:54 PM] suspended reason: 15 minutes in I have a very clear idea of what's in store for me, which would involve sitting through various predictable rants and stereotypes and type of guy'ing etc, and yet the theater is small, so if I leave, everyone in the auditorium will see me leave
[5:54 PM] suspended reason: There is no way for me to exit without "writing" a message to them, essentially, and so I am trapped, unless I can figure out how to write a message which is benign enough that I can stomach broadcasting it
[5:54 PM] suspended reason: For instance, I can clutch my ear to my phone, and put on a very worried expression, as if I've just received terrible news
[5:55 PM] suspended reason: Or I can exit hunched over with a look of pain on my face, as if I'm having a medical emergency
[5:56 PM] suspended reason: In either case, my departure will likely not just be noticed by the crowd, but noticed by the comedian, who will then use the shared experience as the basis for a joke ("I can' see someone's enjoying the comedy")
[5:57 PM] suspended reason: This is increasingly how I'm seeing a lot communication these days, as a kind of modifying surplus on the information base that our presence and our actions already send; that is, our actions already write to/is read by other individuals in our ecological huddle, and speech is a way of producing writing which our actions cannot, or more efficiently than they are able to, or to modify the reading of our actions that would result without communication
[5:58 PM] suspended reason: The semiotic field long pre-dating both language and human beings, and being ~definitional to what it means to be intelligent, to be alive, etc. (Even plants "read" their environment, and many of them also "write" to other organisms as well, through the colors of their flowers, through the chemicals they release strategically, etc)
