[[_Language in Thought and Action_]]:
> as Susanne K. Langer has said, "The symbol-making function is one of man's primary activities... It is the fundamental process of the mind, and goes on all the time." One may try to live a simple life with little concern for symbols of affluence, social status, and the like, but one soon discovers that the rejection of symbolism is itself symbolic. Wearing a necktie is symbolic, but not wearing a necktie is equally symbolic. Parents and children have had bitter quarrels in recent years over hair stylesâ€”long, short, spiked, shaved. Such quarrels are not really about hair but about the symbolic meanings involved in how hair is worn.
