# Personally collected ethnomethods

An especially complicated instance of [moving some activity into a waiting period, to expedite a routine] is the subway commuter's trick of standing on the platform so that when you get in the subway and out at your destination station you'll be standing in front of the exit. Similarly, putting the kettle on the flame first, then attending to bean-grinding or tea-bag selection.

List-and-choose: a way of finding coordination solutions. One player lists options (with the implication than any listed option is amenable to him, and will be agreed-to if chosen) while the other player selects from the list, either a single option (ending the game, via decision) or by narrowing it down to less options, each ostensibly acceptable to the selecting player, and passing the decision back to the initial lister. This game can be played in a sequence of ask/reveal/match or offer/match, with endless theoretical iterations of the offer/match stage (e.g. offer/winnow/winnow/winnow/choose).

## Chapter 3: The Phenomenological Input

_On Schutz and his theory of intersubjectivity._

Schutz's work is founded in phenomenology, and begins with Husserl's idea of "[[natural attitude]]"—the "framework in terms of which we mundanely perceive, interpret and act on the world in which we find ourselves," which is "fundamentally governed by pragmatic considerations":

> In the [[natural attitude]], the perceiver simply believes that "as he sees things, so they are"; the cognizer simply assumes, until he has counter-evidence, that his understanding of his circumstances is adequate, and the actor likewise assumes that actions which were successful in previous similar conditions will be successful in the present situation.

This [[natural attitude]], arguably, is what must be complicated by skepticism in adversarial [[games]] and [[selection|selection games]], where evaluators naturally expect evaluated subjects to strategically mis-represent themselves.

A second crucial phenomenological input is the idea of the "construction" of objects from its sensory presentation. There are always aspects to e.g. a chair which are sensorily undetectable to me at a given moment, but which I fill in by assuming, from a partial view of the chair, the identity of the whole:

> The identification of an object from a perspectival sensory presentation is thus always a "constructive" process even if, within the [[natural attitude]], the nature of this process is entirely obscured from consciousness.

### Verstehen and meaning

_Verstehen_—literally "understanding," is an approach to understanding action from the actor's point of view. Schutz sees it both as the default, everyday, commonsense means of apprehending the social world, and also as a valuable sociological technique. _Verstehen_ is "the particular experiential form in which common-sense thinking takes cognizance of the socio-cultural world" (Schutz). Actions are understood in light of goals, motivations, and other psychological states (desire, repulsion, etc). [[Intentionality|intent]] contextualizes behaviors into larger "projects" which are known more intimately to the actor than observers, but which observers can partially infer from the evidence the actor's project naturally produces as a byproduct of its undertaking. _Verstehende_ interpretation is concerned with the psychological constructs, in the beliefs and interpretations, that cause and determine the patterns of externally visible behavior, in opposition to the formalist or neo-positivist approaches of treating only the external, falsifiable actions as real.

Crucially, Schutz sees verstehen as underlying all scientific knowledge. Schutz:

> In order [for scientist B to control and verify the observational findings of scientist A], B has to know what A has observed, what the goal of his inquiry is, why he thought the observed fact worthy of being observed, i.e. relevant to the scientific problem at hand, etc. This knowledge is commonly called understanding.

In other words, as Heritage writes, "all forms of naturalism and logical empiricism simply presuppose 'intersubjectivity, interaction, intercommunication and language... as the unclarified foundation of these theories.'"

Schutz writes:

> The social world is experienced from the outset as a meaningful one. The Other's body is not experienced as an organism but as a fellow-man, its overt behaviour not as an occurence in the space-time of the outer world, but as our fellow-man's action. We normally "know" what the Other does, for what reason he does it, why he does it at this particular time and in these particular circumstances. That means that we experience our fellow-man's action in terms of his motives and goals.

We (and Schutz) understand our fellow man's actions as "conduct based on a preconceived project"; the subjective meaning of an actor's action is the project which the action is "designed to implement." This project is always hidden in its entirety from outside observers:

> It follows then that _initially_ only the actor knows the meaning of his or her action, i.e. the project or series of projects within which some present action is embedded: "only the actor knows 'when his action starts and where it ends'" (Schutz). The task of fellow-actors, therefore, is necessarily one of _[[inference|inferring]]_ from a [[metonym|fragment]] of the other's conduct and its context what the other's project is, or is likely to be. [See also [[generalized reading]].] Thus any fellow-actor's inferences about what some other is "up to" are inevitably contingent and tend to be subject to revision and adjustment "after the event," i.e. after some next phase of activity has elapsed.

Furthermore, this is not merely how we interpret our fellow man, but how we conceptualize any fellow [[unit of goal]] or unit of action. We equally think of the military as "gearing up" _for_ an invasion, or as being "fearful" of another nation's growing military power. It even extends to inanimate artifacts such as human tools. Schutz:

> A tool, for example, is not experienced as a thing in the outer world (which of course it is also) but in terms of the purpose for which it was designed by more or less anonymous fellow-men and its possible use for others.

The common-sense constructs which verstehen uses for an interpretive framework include:

> typical motives, typical identities, or typical actions given particular typical circumstances or atecedent actions. It involves a "making out" of "what's going on here" from the where and when and who of the activity and from what would be typical or reasonable for that where, when and who. The type constructs used in these procedures are, Schutz asserts (1974), varyingly precise, specific, detailed, familiar, and vague. 

And they are used pragmatically, they are "made to work," making a non-problem of indeterminacy and open-endedness:

> They are entertained as shared "for all practical purposes" and "until demonstrated otherwise." When set against the intimate knowledge which others have of the meanings of their [own] actions, these constructs inevitably "fall short" of complete understanding. Moreover their application is never certain and always involves an element of "risk" that misunderstandings will take place. Yet, "in spite of all these inadequacies, common-sense knowledge of everyday life is sufficient for coming to terms with fellow-men, cultural objects, social institutions—in brief, with social reality" (Schutz 1962).

Crucially, these _verstehende_ processes and constructs are not merely "private, unobservable, or uncontrollable." Heritage, via Schutz, exemplifies this through an example of a public [[selection|selection game]], and the result of _verstehende_ sense-making processes of determining the categorization (and thus action, via the law of [[decision rules]]) of an event via socially available evidence:

> If it were [merely private], the mundane intelligibility of social life would simply collapse and it would be difficult to account, for example, for "the discussion by a trial jury  of whether the defendant had shown 'pre-meditated malice' or 'intent' in killing a person, whether he was capable of knowing the consequences of his deed, etc."

In short, the social world—social reality—is a "matrix of activity" that its participants interpret through "intersubjectively available constructs which 'determine their behavior, define the goal of their action, the means available for attaining them—in brief, which help them to find their bearings within the natural and socio-cultural environment' (1962)." Sociology, then, must be "engaged in developing models of the actors' constructs of the social world, their judgemental processes and their consequent actions under varying conditions." Schutz believes fields in the [[inexact sciences]] like econ and poli sci _are already_, albeit unwittingly, preceding in this model-building fashion.

### Intersubjectivity, aka "social reality"

Schutz takes the late Wittgenstein tack, eschewing Husserl's search for transcendental, "pristine,"" or fail-safe method of establishing intersubjectivity. Instead, like [[David Chapman]]'s "kludge," he sees intersubjectivity as something "routinely 'solved' by social actors in the course of their dealings with one another." The problem of other minds is not so much philosophical as empirical, the task of grokking other minds' contents (motivations, [[intentionality|intentions]]) that are relevant or "operative" in a given situation.

This social reality "is derived solely from the fact that the _actors_ sustain the idealizations _and has no other 'external' guarantee than this maintenance._"

### Rationality

Schutz can well accept "a view of rational action as involving, _inter alia_, a process of considered choice among goals and among means for achieving them."" But because we only have very partial access to the facts, to others' minds, to the set of means available at our disposal and the consequence of employing them, Schutz believes that "rationality" as it is typically conceived is an unrealistic and fruitless yardstick. As Schutz writes, there "are everywhere gaps, intermissions, discontinuities" in our knowledge. We rarely weigh the costs and benefits of two courses of action in a rational, economic frame, calculating the cost of one avenue of pursuit against another. We must make decisions often on the spot, under high time pressure, and cannot consider all the variables even if we had the desire. 

Instead, Schutz advocates for better understanding "reasonableness."
