Solution cascades: When a solution to a problem is quickly discovered and adopting, leading to a new equilibrium of play.

From [[opticratics]] entry:

> Actors in an [[[opticratics|opticratic]]] landscape are constantly watchful as to the significance of—which is to say, the structure of payoffs accorded to—different actions, cues, and appearances. Since most of humans' games are fundamentally social, humans' assessments today deeply structure the kinds of optimizations that will be implemented or evaluated tomorrow. This dynamic, of course, gives rise to fads:

> > [Haitians have the mindset that] getting more medicine of any type is always a good thing and will make them healthier, and doctors are these strange heartless people who will prevent them from taking a stomach medication just because maybe they don’t have a stomach problem at this exact moment. As a result, they lie like heck. I didn’t realize exactly how much they were lying until I heard the story, now a legend at our clinic, of the man who came in complaining of vaginal discharge. He had heard some woman come in complaining of vaginal discharge and get lots of medication for it, so he figured he should try his luck with the same. And this wasn’t an isolated incident, either. Complaints will go in “fads,” so that if a guy comes in complaining of ear pain and gets lots of medicine, on his way out he’ll mention it to the other patients in line and they’ll all mention ear pain too—or so the translators and veteran staff have told me.

> This does not merely happen in Haiti, or the third-world, among the uneducated; it also is characteristic of our legal system. Nightjack, the anonymous police blog which won the Orwell Prize in 2009, recounts:

> > As fads emerge, evaluators catch on and begin devaluing the faddish cue, since it is being widely free-ridden by those who lack the qualities it implies (but wish to appear as if they possess them). 

# Bikhchandani, Hirschleifer, Welch 1998: Learning from the Behavior of Others

> In 1995, management gurus Michael Treacy and Fred Wiersema secretly purchased 50,000 copies of their business strategy book _The Discipline of Market Leaders_ from stores across the nation. The stores they purchased from just happened to be the ones whose sales are monitored to select books from the _New York Times_ bestseller list. Despite mediocre reviews, their book made the bestseller list. Subsequently, the book sold well enough to continue as a bestseller without further demand intervention by the authors.

> Reports of the actions or endorsements of one set of economic decisionmakers often influence the reactions and purchases of others.

> Gibson and Hoglund (1992) describe evidence that animals imitate each other in choice of mate and territories; for example, female guppies are more likely to choose males to mate with whom they have observed being selected by previous females. The propensity to imitate is presumably an evolutionary adaptation that has promoted survival over thousands of generations by allowing individuals to take advantage of the hard-won information of others.

Bikhchandani et al call this "[[sporting vs herding]]" behavior. "Herding may arise when payoffs are similar even if initial information is not. In this case people communicate with each other or observe the actions of others—or the consequences of these actions. The key issue is how individuals determine which alternative is better. Each individual could decide by direct analysis of the alternatives. However, this can be costly and time-consuming, so a plausible alternative is to rely on the information of others.

An _informational cascade_ arises when a person's, e.g. Clarence's, "optimal action does not depend on his private information, and the uninformativeness of Clarence's action means that no further information accumulates." In other words, Clarence may have private information against action X, but the fact that Aaron and Barbara have endorsed action X persuades him to bandwagon; all observers who override private information to copy Clarence will add no "information" to the aggregate decision-making process—in other words, if the sequence is right, a small handful of advocates for X could override an enormous amount of privately held information _against_ X.

> once a cascade starts, public information stops accumulating. An early preponderance towards adoption or rejection causes subsequent individuals to ignore their private signals, which thus never join the public pool of knowledge... As soon as the public pool becomes even modestly more informative than the signal of a single individual, the next individual defers to the actions of predecessors and a cascade begins.

There are also interesting negative feedback processes, though, which undermine the authors' model. Typically, in a free speech system, if people think X is overrated, they'll often go out of their way to bash on it.
