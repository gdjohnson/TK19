# Bikhchandani, Hirschleifer, Welch 1998: Learning from the Behavior of Others

> In 1995, management gurus Michael Treacy and Fred Wiersema secretly purchased 50,000 copies of their business strategy book _The Discipline of Market Leaders_ from stores across the nation. The stores they purchased from just happened to be the ones whose sales are monitored to select books from the _New York Times_ bestseller list. Despite mediocre reviews, their book made the bestseller list. Subsequently, the book sold well enough to continue as a bestseller without further demand intervention by the authors.

> Reports of the actions or endorsements of one set of economic decisionmakers often influence the reactions and purchases of others.

> Gibson and Hoglund (1992) describe evidence that animals imitate each other in choice of mate and territories; for example, female guppies are more likely to choose males to mate with whom they have observed being selected by previous females. The propensity to imitate is presumably an evolutionary adaptation that has promoted survival over thousands of generations by allowing individuals to take advantage of the hard-won information of others.

Bikhchandani et al call this "[[sporting vs herding|herding]]" behavior. "Herding may arise when payoffs are similar even if initial information is not. In this case people communicate with each other or observe the actions of others—or the consequences of these actions. The key issue is how individuals determine which alternative is better. Each individual could decide by direct analysis of the alternatives. However, this can be costly and time-consuming, so a plausible alternative is to rely on the information of others.

An _informational cascade_ arises when a person's, e.g. Clarence's, "optimal action does not depend on his private information, and the uninformativeness of Clarence's action means that no further information accumulates." In other words, Clarence may have private information against action X, but the fact that Aaron and Barbara have endorsed action X persuades him to bandwagon; all observers who override private information to copy Clarence will add no "information" to the aggregate decision-making process—in other words, if the sequence is right, a small handful of advocates for X could override an enormous amount of privately held information _against_ X.

> once a cascade starts, public information stops accumulating. An early preponderance towards adoption or rejection causes subsequent individuals to ignore their private signals, which thus never join the public pool of knowledge... As soon as the public pool becomes even modestly more informative than the signal of a single individual, the next individual defers to the actions of predecessors and a cascade begins.

There are also interesting negative feedback processes, though, which undermine the authors' model. Typically, in a free speech system, if people think X is overrated, they'll often go out of their way to bash on it.
