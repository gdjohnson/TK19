# Twitter exchange with Devarbol

I think most takes about bullshit jobs have the two pillar arguments brought into the discourse by Graeber.
Both of them are bad.

Devarbol
The first one is assuming that it's very easy to organize the multi-stage economic process especially if it produces mostly intangible things and happens in the joint production in the several stages which is hard to monitor.

Devarbol
This one is obviously not true and anyone who worked on any serious project can understand how hard is to make people do the right stuff even if you know how, but most of the time we don't know.

Devarbol
The other one is trying to ask people themselves what do they think about how their job is useful or not.
But we don't do work for our self-satisfaction, we do it for other people and most of the time we don't really understand why do they need it.

Devarbol
Also, I have the exact opposite view of general socialistish thought about the alienation:
Interfaces and black boxes are actually good, even trying to understand how one firm works in full will probably make you insane and unable to work.

One of the biggest issues I have with Graeber's view is that he completely hand-waves away game-theoretic problems of communication
So, e.g., he has this protestant objection to PR/advertising as non-productive in that it's playing a zero-sum game with red queen effects

But it's like, good luck getting the entire world to simultaneously disarm. That's an enormous coordination problem. You might as well get mad b/c people spend time & money making themselves look good. "Well if everyone just stopped wearing makeup/paying for sexy clothing"

Suspended Reason
I suppose socialist worldviews in general are premised on a belief that coordination is easier than we think, and easier than it feels/appears under capitalism. That competition won't come clawing up between the cracks of any egalitarian foundation you try to lay down.
