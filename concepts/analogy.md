_The drive toward the formation of metaphors is the fundamental human drive._ ([[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], "On Truth & Lies")

Because no two things are exactly alike, not even the same thing over time, to draw a metaphor—this is like that, this _is_ that—is to categorize, to say "these things are alike in given ways, and I will overlook their difference, here, in favor of their similarity." In some sense, all we have, in the realm of the [[inexact sciences]], is metaphor—we can categorize, or create new categories, or redefine categories, but we are always saying _this is like that_, _these things share properties which are salient to our purposes_. 

[[Andrea Long Chu]] writes on [[Maggie Nelson]]'s _Freedom_:
> You see the problem with this kind of argumentation: False equivalences abound, on both sides, and the question devolves into not just which equivalences are false but which false equivalences are, as it were, falser than others. Is racism like art? Art like climate change? An open letter like the police? Nelson writes, “Acting as if the world neatly divides … into problematic, ethically turbulent, essentially dangerous people who should stay ‘over there,’ and nonproblematic, ethically good, essentially safe people who should be allowed to stay ‘over here’ is not our only option. After all, what I’ve just described is a prison.” So which is worse, you tell me — a protester calling _Scaffold_ a “slap in the face” or Maggie Nelson comparing that rhetoric to incarceration?

# Analogy as the core of cognition

Each analogy casts light on a part of the whole; the many-headed quality of the phenomenon is seen in its reflection on many-angled mirrors. To say "science is politics; politics is war" is to say that there is something of politics in science, and of war in politics. The "is," while technically an equivalent, is in error or a shorthand for "is in part."

## Hofstadter 2001: Analogy as the Core of Cognition

_Full text saved as [library entry](/Hofstadter2001.pdf)._

Analogy as the "very blue that fills the whole sky of cognition—analogy is everything, or very nearly so." Hofstadter offers a CogSci-informed update of "associationism," the idea that our cognition is at its core associative.

Visual perception, organized into patterns, triggers and generates [[concepts]]:

> Vision takes an input of millions of retinal dots and gives an output of concepts — often words or phrases, such as “duck,” “Victorian house,” “funky chair,” “Joyce Carol Oates hairdo,” or “looks sort of like President Eisenhower.” The (visual) perceptual process, in other words, can be thought of as the triggering of mental categories — often standard lexical items — by scenes.

_See also the [[William James|Jamesian]] concept [[brute association]]._

The "family resemblance" structure of [[concepts]] is a product of analogic extension:

> The triggering of prior mental categories by some kind of input—whether sensory or more abstract—is, I insist, an act of analogy-making. Why is this? Because whenever a set of incoming stimuli activates one or more mental categories, some amount of slippage must occur (no instance of a category ever being precisely identical to a prior instance). Categories are quintessentially fluid entities; they adapt to a set of incoming stimuli and try to align themselves with it. The process of inexact matching between prior categories and new things being perceived (whether those “things” are physical objects or bite-size events or grand sagas) is analogy-making par excellence... After all, it is the mental mapping onto each other of two entities — one old and sound asleep in the recesses of long- term memory, the other new and gaily dancing on the mind’s center stage — that in fact differ from each other in a myriad of ways.

> [T]he domain of the word “shadow” is a blurry region in semantic space, as is any human category, and — here I hark back to my initial refrain — that blur is due to the subtleties of mapping situations onto other situations-due, in other words, to the human facility of making analogies. The point is, a concept is a package of analogies.

### Concepts & algorithmic "voting"

(Predecessor in spirit to Yudkowsky's "How An Algorithm Feels From The Inside" and "Disguised Queries," and the general concept of algorithmic categorization at LessWrong.)

All lexical items are concepts, including rhetorical "concepts" and filler words. (Hofstadter mentions "probably," "ain't," as concepts e.g.) What makes them concepts is that they have a time and a place: a situation which is appropriate to deploy them. On how brains make this choice:

> The choice is incredibly subtle and depends on dozens if not hundreds of variables, all unconsciously felt and all slightly contributing to a “vote” among my neurons, which then allow just one of these terms (or some other term) to come bubbling up out of my dormant Italian mental lexicon.

Throughout, Hofstadter emphasizes situational fit over/as traditional conceptions of "meaning."

In addition to the belief that all lexical items are concepts (or "chunks"), Hofstadter also sees a sea of non-linguistic concepts: chunks that have no language, but exist as a distinct feeling or memory in individuals' minds. _See [[Excess of Signification]]._

### Analogic thinking is top-down thinking (or "high level perception")

_See [[predictive processing]] and [[proto-predictive processing]]._

> Once there are structures in short-term memory, then the perceptual process can be directed at any of them (this is, in fact, the kind of high-level perception that forms the core of the Copycat and Tabletop models of analogy-making — see Hofstadter and FARG 1995), the upshot of which will be the activation — thanks to analogy — of further nodes in long-term memory, which in turn causes new “fish” to be pulled out of that brine and placed into short- term memory’s bucket. What we have described is, in short, the following central cognitive loop: A long-term memory node is accessed, transferred to short-term memory and there unpacked to some degree, which yields new structures to be perceived, and the high-level perceptual act activates yet further nodes, which are then in turn accessed, transferred, unpacked, etc., etc.

> Each person, as life progresses, develops a set of high-level concepts that they tend to favor, and their perception is continually seeking to cast the world in terms of those concepts. The perceptual process is thus far from neutral or random, but rather it seeks, whenever possible, to employ high-level concepts that one is used to, that one believes in, that one is comfortable with, that are one’s pet themes. If the current perception of a situation leads one into a state of cognitive dissonance, then one goes back and searches for a new way to perceive it. Thus the avoidance of mental discomfort — the avoidance of cognitive dissonance — constitutes a powerful internal force that helps to channel the central loop in what amounts to a strongly goal-driven manner.

### Weak Sapir-Whorf and Cognitive Gadgets

This leads Hofstadter to support for weak Sapir-Whorf, where our "perceptual attractors"—"long-term mental loci that are zoomed into when situations are encountered"—and the strengthening effect of concept handles—limit and shape what & how we think:

> We are prepared to see, and we see easily, things for which our language and culture hand us ready-made labels. When those labels are lacking, even though the phenomena may be all around us, we may quite easily fail to see them. The perceptual attractors that we each possess... are the filters through which we scan and sort reality, and thereby they determine what we perceive on high and low levels.

Thus, names, or "handles," are a kind of cognitive gadget.

### Compressive communication: "Just add water"

> The mode by which such replication is attempted is essentially a drastic compression of the complex symbolic dance occurring in the sender’s brain into a temporal chain of sounds or a string of visual signs, which are then absorbed by the receiver’s brain, where, by something like the reverse of said compression — a process that I will here term __“just adding water”__ — a new symbolic dance is launched in the second brain. The human brain at one end drains the water out to produce __“powdered food for thought,”__ and the one at the other end adds the water back, to produce full-fledged food for thought.

## Discussion

Q1: How universal are some of these analogic extensions? Hofstadter asks as well—did Bach have a sense of "burnout"? Did Babylonians feel resentful for being "micromanaged"?

# Lakoff 1993: The Contemporary Theory of Metaphor

[PDF Link](/Lakoff1993.pdf)

Lakoff believes conceptual metaphors are physically instantiated through neural connections between areas in the brain that light up simultaneously, e.g. affection and warmth regularly co-occurring creates a connection.

# Agre 1985: Structure of Everyday Life

Agre sees brains as having a conceptual lattice, that ladders up in abstraction; at the top are what he terms *generic models*. 

If I have situation A and situation B, and situations A and B are analogous, it's by virtue of them both being instances of some C; if something is true of A that would be useful to carry over to B, it can be abstracted and put on C, and brought down to B.

# Analogy as the foundation of language

# [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], Truth & Lies in a Nonmoral Sense

> What then is truth? A movable host of metaphors, metonymies, and; anthropomorphisms: in short, a sum of human relations which have been poetically and rhetorically intensified, transferred, and embellished, and which, after long usage, seem to a people to be fixed, canonical, and binding. Truths are illusions which we have forgotten are illusions—they are metaphors that have become worn out and have been drained of sensuous force, coins which have lost their embossing and are now considered as metal and no longer as coins.

**Discussion**

*One must both possess a tool and know (at least at an unconscious level) that one possesses it, in order to deploy it. In the case of a Jean who has forgotten he knows the year 1603, but guesses it anyway, he (subconsciously) possesses the tool (knowledge) needed to solve the problems in front of him. Suppose he only knew, from cheating, that the answers to the multiple choice were A-C-A-B, in order. Here, he again has the knowledge (tool) needed to solve the problem. And crucially, we can accomplish many goals without the proper tools through sheer luck, as the situation of a Jean who from pure guessing gets all right answers. The tool is simply what improves one's performance, meaning one can more reliably solve a problem, or achieve an end, through its deployment. Notice the non-instrumental version, "Does Jean know things about English history?" is true of any possible Jean who can understand the language of the question: at the very least, he understands history happened in the past, and that English history primarily involved the English, and probably some other Europeans too.*
