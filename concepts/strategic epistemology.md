# Strategic ignorance

There is a moral dimension to strategic ignorance, which is perhaps the dimension most commented-on. If you can compartmentalize and deny that you are hurting someone, you can continue doing it. (This is how the meat industry works.)

"Justifiability is the leash on our freedom." (Maq 3)

[[John Boyd]], “Organic Design for Command & Control”: 
> In order to win, we should operate at a faster tempo or rhythm than our adversaries—or, better yet, get inside [the] adversary’s Observation-Orientation-Decision-Action time cycle or loop … Such activity will make us appear ambiguous (unpredictable) thereby generate confusion and disorder among our adversaries.
