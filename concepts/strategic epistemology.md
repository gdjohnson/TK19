# Strategic ignorance

There is a moral dimension to strategic ignorance, which is perhaps the dimension most commented-on. If you can compartmentalize and deny that you are hurting someone, you can continue doing it. (This is how the meat industry works.)

"Justifiability is the leash on our freedom." (Maq 3)

[[Adam Elkus]]:
> Broadly speaking, Alice ideally must first be sphinxlike in character to pull any of this off. She must foster [[ambiguity]] about what her ultimate goals are in order to have an advantage over those around her. This style of behavior is called “robust action” in sociology. For Alice to be an ideal manipulator, her actions must be interpretable from multiple perspectives at once, potentially function as moves in multiple [[concepts/games|games]] at once, and conceal her public and private motivations. This maintains her flexibility and discretion and thwarts attempts by rivals to narrow her space of choices. Forced clarification of her [[commitment|commitments]] and lock-in to hard goals only gives Bob an ability to constrain her.

[[John Boyd]], “Organic Design for Command & Control”: 
> In order to win, we should operate at a faster tempo or rhythm than our adversaries—or, better yet, get inside [the] adversary’s Observation-Orientation-Decision-Action time cycle or loop … Such activity will make us appear ambiguous (unpredictable) thereby generate confusion and disorder among our adversaries.
