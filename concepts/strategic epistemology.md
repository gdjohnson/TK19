# Strategic ignorance

There is a moral dimension to strategic ignorance, which is perhaps the dimension most commented-on. If you can compartmentalize and deny that you are hurting someone, you can continue doing it. (This is how the meat industry works.)

"Justifiability is the leash on our freedom." (Maq 3)
