Rules "allow decision makers to process information in a less effortful manner" (Shah and Oppenheimer 2008). Like scripts and Schelling points, they allow better tacit coordination, and minimize the significant cognitive overhead involved in [[theory of mind]] projections and strategic interaction more generally.

Attitudes toward rules differ. Some see them more consequentially in terms of payoff matrices: breaking a law isn't off the table, it's merely risky. Others appear to be more "cultural dopes" who internalize or [[fetish|fetishize]] the [[social reality]] of a given game, and cannot see these rules as provisional, as guidelines, or as payoff constraints. Following Venkatesh Rao's "Gervais Principle," and Suk-Young Chwe's theories of Jane Austen, we can call this first group "clueless" and the second group "strategic" or "enlightened."

Said Achmiz: Everything I ever needed to know, I learned from World of Warcraft

> A lot of supersititons arose [in the early days of WoW] about how game mechanics worked, which abilities had which effects, what caused bosses to do this or that, etc—all the usual human responses to complex phenomena where discerning causation is hard.

Rules must feel permanent, rather than contingent, to feel meaningful instead of arbitrary. Taekwan Kim, in "What Is 'Degenerate'?" (2014) exposes this dynamic with reference to players' ability to tinker with default game settings, and their avoidance of customization:

> You avoid even looking at the options because that's how you keep from breaking into the realization that you are playing it somehow "less real" than you could [i.e., not the default or standard way]. You keep it default because that's how you keep the gaminess of it all—the fluidity of its rules—from shattering your rule immersion.
