## Kilcullen 2006: Twenty-eight Articles

Discussing the viral circulation of his counterinsurgency guide "Twenty Eight Articles," Kilcullen writes:

> The less positive aspect of such circulation was the tendency by many readers, despite the warning at the front of the article, to use it as a template. As I have emphasized in detail already, there are no standard templates or universal solutions in counterinsurgency. Fundamentals and principles exist, but they require judgment in application, and there is no substitute for studying the environment in detail, developing locally tailored solutions, and being prepared to adjust them in an agile way as the situation develops.

"Small is beautiful":

> Another natural tendency is to go for largescale, mass programs. In particular, we have a tendency to template ideas that succeed in one area and transplant them into another, and we tend to take small programs that work and try to replicate them on a larger scale. Again, this is usually a mistake: Often programs succeed because of specific local conditions of which we are unaware, or because their very smallness kept them below the enemyâ€™s radar and helped them flourish unmolested

## Context sensitivity of linguistic meaning

Bourdieu, _The Field of Cultural Production_:

> The meaning of a work (artistic, literary, philosophical, etc) changes automatically with each change in the field within which it is situated for the spectator or reader. This effect is most immediate in the case of so-called classic works, which change constantly as the universe of coexistent works changes.

> One of the major difficulties of the social history of philosophy, art or literature, is that it has to reconstruct these spaces of original possibles which, because they were part of the self-evident data of the situation, remained unremarked and are therefore unlikely to be mentioned in contemporary accounts, chronicles or memoirs.
