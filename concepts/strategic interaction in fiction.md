## S1E1 Succession

S1E1, *[[Succession]]*. Tom and Shiv, fiance and fiancee, are chatting about Shiv's dad's (Logan) upcoming birthday. 

> Tom: Shiv, it's a fucking disaster. I need to strategize my gift. What can I get him he'll love? 
>
> Shiv: I don't know, my dad doesn't really like things. 
>
> Tom: It needs to say I respect you, but I'm not awed by you. And that I like you, but I need you to like me before I can love you.
>
> Shiv: Look everything you get him will mean equal amount of nothing, so make sure it looks like ten to fifteen grand's worth and you're good.

[[Jane Austen]], as we'll see, believes that couples are the ultimate strategic units: at their best, marked by deep trust, shared exposure/experience, and united in joint interest. Tom and Shiv's problem, as we'll also come to see, is that they're not exactly united in interest *or* trust. But Tom, at least at this stage, believes they are, hence the strategizing.

The other thing I like about this excerpt is that Tom explicitly frames the gift as a communication. "It needs to *say*" X and Y. It has a purpose, and that purpose is manipulating their relationship (Tom and Logan's). Tom's longterm goal, as future seasons reveal, is to take over the company as CEO, a position Logan currently holds, and thus their relationship—specfically, Logan's impression and opinion of Tom—is crucial.

## The Office / The Gervais Principle

[[Venkatesh Rao]]'s ["Gervais Principle"](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2009/10/07/the-gervais-principle-or-the-office-according-to-the-office/) speculates that an org tends to have three kinds of employees: sociopaths, the clueless, and losers. Sociopaths are in a constant battle for power and dominance. The clueless are "company men" who genuinely believe in the organization and are too stupid to think critically about their situation; they lean toward being "cultural dopes." Losers are those at the bottom who make a straightforward exchange of time for money while still looking out for their self-interest, they tend to find meaning outside the organization, and the most enlightened among them do the minimum work possible to keep coasting. Losers and sociopaths more fit the free & rational actor model of existentialism than it does the "cultural dope" model of [[structuralism]] (see [[Generalized Compatibilism]]).

These three groups talk to each other in different dialects: powertalk, posturetalk, babytalk, and straight-talk. Powertalk occurs whenever sociopaths encounter each other. Sociopaths see power in every interaction, and thus every conversation and exchange of information between them leads to power shifts, and must be controlled meticulously to maintain maximum power.

> What distinguishes Powertalk is that with every word uttered, the power equation between the two speakers shifts just a little. Sometimes both gain slightly, at the expense of some poor schmuck. Sometimes one yields ground to the other. Powertalk in other words, is a consequential language.

Babytalk is equally manipulative, but is done asymmetrically, to those clueless who are unable to speak powertalk or detect when babytalk is being spoken to them. Enlightened losers and high-up sociopaths both speak babytalk to clueless managers. 

Posturetalk is a clueless attempt at powertalk. Straight talk—what @amirism might call a straightforward discussion of the "rules of the game"—can only occur between individuals who have nothing to lose or gain: "It is the ordinary  (if rare) utilitarian language of the sane, with no ulterior motives flying around. The mean-what-you-say-and-say-what-you-mean stuff between two people in a fixed, asymmetric power relationship, who don’t want or need to play real or fake power games."

Venkat goes on to give an example from _The Office_ of fluent powertalk, here between enlightened loser Jim and sociopathic powerhouse David Wallace.

> At a Dunder-Mifflin management party, shortly after Michael and Jan disclose their affair to David Wallace, per HR requirements, Wallace casually invites Jim to blow off the party for a while and shoot hoops in the backyard. Once outside, Wallace nonchalantly asks, “So what’s up with Jan and Michael?” He is clearly fishing for information, having observed the bizarre couple dynamics at the party.
> 
> Jim replies, “I wouldn’t know…(pregnant pause)…where to begin.” (slight laugh)
> 
> David Wallace laughs in return. This is as eloquent as such a short fragment of Powertalk can get. Here are just some of the messages being communicated by the six words and the meaningful pause and laugh.
>
> 1. Message 1: It is a complex situation (literal).
> 2. Message 2: I understand you think something bizarre is going on. I am confirming your suspicion. It is a bizarre mess, and you should be concerned.
> 3. Message 3: This is the first significant conversation between us, and I am signaling to you that I am fluent in Powertalk.
> 4. Message 4: I know how to communicate useful information while maintaining plausible deniability.
> 5. Message 5: I am not so gratified at this sign of attention from you  that I am going to say foolish things that could backfire on me.
> 6. Message 6: I am aware of my situational leverage and the fact that you need me. I am not so overawed that I am giving it all up for free.
> 7. Message 7: I am being non-committal enough that you can pull back or steer this conversation to safer matters if you like. I know how to give others wiggle room, safe outs and exits.
> 8. Message 8: You still have to earn my trust. But let’s keep talking. What do you have that I could use?

Crucially in powertalk, you play with real table stakes; "the currency is most often reality-information." (i.e. _epistemic capital_, as valuable as symbolic capital) The other dialects (Venkat claims) play without stakes. I don't quite understand this, because posturetalk and babytalk both seem to attempt, manipulatively, to bring about realities (i.e. there are stakes, the speakers are trying to make something happen). They're just performed by, or received by, the incompetents/clueless.

(Sidenote: I've been wondering if it'd be useful to drag in Carse's [[finite and infinite games]], because it doesn't seem like a coincidence that this kind of interaction happens so much in business and high society (that is, over literal and symbolic capital). There are ways of being that seem more cooperative and less full of conflict, where strategic interaction looks very very different—more like improv, less like warfare.)

Theory of mind is one of the biggest skills that makes a sociopath a sociopath—though, as [[Jane Austen]] illustrates in her fiction, there is a blindspot insofar as high status people do not actively model the mentalities of low status people, which leads them to misunderstand their subordinates' motivations. So is context-sensitivity: the clueless, in Venkat/Ricky Gervais's formulation, fail in part by following "formulas" for behavior, without an artfulness in deploying them. Thus, in a salary negotiation, Michael Scott "prints off negotiation tactics from Wikipedia and attempts to use a series of recommended formulaic tactics. First he tries switching chairs and rooms to disorient Darryl. He merely disorients himself. Next he tries to follow a rule 'not to be the first to speak.' Sadly, he can't stand the tension, and oblivious to the [[knowingness|irony]], breaks the silence with 'I will not be the first to speak.' At which point Darryl calmly comes back with, 'Alright, I can start.'" In other words, like all human social assessments (cf flirting), the _symbols_ or [[metonyms]] that can encode or [[signaling theory|signal]] deeper qualities, the markers of power must either be hard-to-fake, either by being _costly_ or being _[[anti-inductive]]_.

> Why can’t you learn Sociopath tactics from a book or Wikipedia? It is not that the tactics themselves are misguided, but that their application by non-Sociopaths is usually useless, for three reasons.The first is that you have to decide what tactics to use and when, based on a real sense of the relative power and alignment of interests with the other party, which the Losers and Clueless typically lack. This real-world information is what makes for tactical surprise. Otherwise your application of even the most subtle textbook tactics can be predicted and easily countered by any Sociopath who has also read the same book. Null information advantage. The second reason is that tactics make sense only in the context of an entire [[narrative]] (including mutual assessments of personality, strengths, weaknesses and history) of a given interpersonal relationship. The Clueless have no sense of [[narrative]] rationality, and the Losers are too trapped in their own stories to play to other scripts. Both the Clueless and Losers are too self-absorbed to put in much work developing accurate and usable mental models of others. The result is one-size-fits-all-situations tactical choices which are easily anticipated and deflected.

Note: both of these reasons can be summed up by "context-sensitivity." This is a real cognitive skill! It takes serious computation! In that vein, I'm tempted to say that winning in [[anti-inductive]] games is not so much a costly [[signaling theory|signal]] as it is an _indice_, much like the depth of an elephant seal's roar is directly, causally, and unfakeably correlated with body size.

## [[Jane Austen]]

Many examples supplemented by Suk-Young Chwe's _Jane Austen: Game Theorist_. Chwe notes that Austen refers to strategic thinking as "penetration," "foresight," and "sagacity."

### Sense and Sensibility

[[Jane Austen|Austen]] has a number of names, in her novels, for different parts of strategic interaction: "foresight" (in the sense of prediction and simulation), "sagacity," and "penetration" (in the sense of seeing through appearances, to reality) [Suk-Young Chwe, _Jane Austen: Game Theorist_]. _Sense and Sensibility_'s Elinor "possessed a strength of understanding, and coolness of judgment"—clear perception, unbiased by emotions, being two of the "gamesman" qualities [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] singles out.

And strategic maneuvering, especially in matters of courtship and finance (tied up as they are in matters of inheritance and dowry), is the foundation of [[Jane Austen|Austen]]'s drama. Suk-Young Chwe:

> Lucy Steele, a distant cousin of Lady Middleton, confides in Elinor [who has had somewhat of a tryst with Edward] that she has been secretly engaged with Edward for four years. Elinor easily understands Lucy's strategic objective in telling her so: "it required no other consideration of probabilities to make it natural that Lucy should be jealous; and that she was so, her very confidence was a proof. What other reason for the disclosure of the affair could there be, but that Elinor might be informed by it of Lucy's superior claims on Edward, and be taught to avoid him in the future?"

Later, Elinor reveals to her sister Marianne that, on receiving this information, she realized quickly that Lucy's "suspicions" had to be "opposed," principally by "endeavouring to appear indifferent where [she was in actuality] most deeply interested." Suk-Young Chwe calls this "self-command" on Elinor's part, a strategic ("sensible") restraint in contrast with Marianne's cult of "sensual" sensibility, her romantic inclination toward emotional expression at all times. [[Jane Austen|Austen]], as I read her, takes the side not of authenticity—as romantic worldviews do, with their worship of "sincerity" and self-expression as ends in themselves—but rather sees authenticity or inauthenticity as instruments which can be used productively or unproductively as ends.

One of the principle biases affecting characters in [[Jane Austen|Austen]]'s novels is that of "eagerness of mind" (as S&S's Marianne is attributed). It is an overactive imagination [Suk-Young Chwe] and a desire to believe some preferred state of affairs. The two other primary strategic impediments are what Suk-Young Chwe calls being a "strategic sophomore"—in short, being overly confident in one's strategic abilities—and being naive or "clueless," in the same sense Venkat intends in "The Gervais Principle," of uncritically taking public appearances as genuine reality. Suk-Young Chwe:

> Mrs. Dashwood's belief in Willoughby is based largely on his manner and appearance: "Has not his behaviour to Marianne and to all of us, for at least the last fortnight, declared that he loved and considered her as his future wife?"

When an overactive imagination and sophomoric overconfidence combine, we see characters like Emma Woodhouse or Marianne Dashwood making inappropriately sized inferential/abductive leaps from their observed information. Thus, when Colonel Brandon in S&S tells a story of a woman of whom Marianne reminds him, Elinor (Austen's ideal strategist) "connect[s] his emotion with the tender recollection of past regard," but does not attempt—since she has no evidence to base it on—any further speculation as to in what way he tenderly regards this woman, or the specifics of their history. It is enough, for her, to have firm reasons for believing only that the regard is tender, and their history meaningful. Marianne, meanwhile, "would not have done so little," [[Jane Austen|Austen]] writes—"The whole story would have been speedily formed under her active imagination." This is a species of epistemic humility that we might call abductive humility, perhaps somewhat related to Sarah Perry's concept of "[[indexical]] geniuses," who refuse to speculate into generalizations. (We might say Elinor is in a Goldilocks zone of abductive ambition, whereas Marianne is too hot and Sarah's indexical geniuses are too cold.)

After Marianne has her predictions repeatedly upset, she vows that, henceforth, her "feelings shall be governed and [her] temper improved." 

We can add to Suk-Young Chwe's list a fourth error mode, a cousin of desire-heavy cognition, which is top-heavy cognition. Like ideology, top-heavy cognition is expert at "explaining away" apparently contradictory evidence as, in fact, supporting their favored hypothesis.

[[Theory of mind]] reigns prominent as it must:

> Elinor uses her strategic skills throughout. She convinces Marianne not to accept the gift of a horse from Willoughby early on in his supposed courtship, not by arguing for its impropriety ("She knew her sister's temper. Opposition on so tender a subject would only attach her the more to her own opinions") but by saying that the horse would inconvenience their dear mother.

Marianne, meanwhile, "expected from other people the same opinions and feelings as her own, and she judged of their motives by the immediate effect of their actions on herself."

### Emma

Suk-Young Chwe: "Pride in one's strategic skills [e.g. in the case of Emma Woodhouse] can lead to their overextension for the purpose of impression others and also leaves one open to manipulation through flatter." That is, pride is like [[decadence]]; it leads to neglect over watchfulness, complacency over action, a misplaced absence of anxiety or an overestimate of security.

Mr. Elton builds a theory of Emma as interested in him, from various pieces of evidence, and believes he receives "confirmers" when he tests that theory enactively (e.g. with his sonnett submission). But there was, in reality, a different way the metonyms "added up." Earlier in the novel, Emma and Harriet pass Mr. Elton's vicarage, and Emma expresses interest in entering, but cannot thinking of a "pretence" for going in—i.e., an alternate high-level account that "explains" the visible behavior.

### Couplings as strategic partnerships

Suk-Young Chwe: The "post-game recap, in which a couple reviews the choices and motivations of others and themselves, is often the moment of greatest intimacy."

> This time Elizabeth accepts [Mr. Darcy's proposal], and together they immediately go through a play-by-play analysis including details such as what Mr. Darcy thought when Elizabeth unexpectedly showed up with the Gardiners at Pemberley, Elizabeth’s surprise at being treated with such warmness there, Mr. Darcy’s motivation “to shew you, by every civility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to,” and finally how Mr. Darcy personally verified, by direct observation, that Jane had real affection for Mr. Bingley, and persuaded Mr. Bingley of this fact (PP, p. 410). Later, Elizabeth cannot help engaging in still more post-game discussion. “[R]ising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr. Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her” (PP, p. 421). Elizabeth asks, “[D]id you admire me for my impertinence?... Why, especially, when you called, did you look as if you did not care about me?... I wonder when you would have spoken, if I had not asked you!” (PP, pp. 421–22). 

> After Anne and Captain Wentworth realize their affection for each other, “they could indulge in those retrospections and acknowledgements, and especially in those explanations of what had directly preceded the present moment, which were so poignant and so ceaseless in interest” (P, p. 262)

### [[Belief]] as discursive intervention

In _Emma_, Mr. Knightley regularly expresses skepticism and light criticism of Mr. Frank Churchill; later, when Emma discloses her love for Mr. Knightley, Knightley immediately becomes more gracious and charitable to Frank, and wonders why he was ever so harsh. The implication is that his public beliefs about Churchill were strategic interventions into group opinion aimed at undermining Mr. Churchill's standing as a sexual rival in winning over Emma. Now that the rivalry has disappeared, there is no more need for animosity. (See also [[torque epistemology]] and [[compensation]] entries.)
