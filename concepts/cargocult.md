_The surface form of a thing is mimicked, with the expectation that the thing's full function will follow, but of course the true form of a thing, its complex situation in the world, is complex and hidden, requires more careful study than has been performed. The cargoculters do not know this because they are not even aware that there is or could be such a further submersion in the world. They cannot fathom that reality and tool-making could be as complex as they are because their culture has not developed as extensively as the culture of their cargoculting's target._

## James 1890: Principles of Psychology ("Reasoning")

Cargocult might best be understood via [[William James|James]]'s carving of [[brute association]] versus mechanistic, theorizing [[reasoning]]. Brute association lacks the real understanding of mechanism present in reasoning:

> Suppose I say, when offered a piece of cloth, "I won’t buy that; it looks as if it would fade," meaning merely that something about it suggests the idea of fading to my mind—my judgment, though possibly correct, is not reasoned, but purely empirical; but, if I can say that into the color there enters a certain dye which I know to be chemically unstable, and that therefore the color will fade, my judgment is reasoned. The notion of the dye which is one of the parts of the cloth, is the connecting link between the latter and the notion of fading.

(By "purely empirical" [[William James|James]] means "brute associative.")

Where one mode "simply associates phenomena in their entirety," reasoning understands causality. The original cargocults, in believing that an emulation of the [[ritual|rituals]] or garb of American servicemen would bring cargodrops, made the same mistake as the skeptical cloth purchaser above: an association (cloth and fading, servicemen and airdrops) is treated without consideration of its many parts, its complex behavioral emergences, or its causal direction, but merely as if one begot the other, as if the appearance of one would naturally bring about the other, since the two are so frequently contiguous or proximate "in their entirety." 

But there is the further step that irrelevant parts of these associated wholes are not just given lacking relevance or "essentiality" to the desired target, but are further _reified_ as directly bringing about the target.

## Graham: Hackers and Painters

> It seems strange to have to emphasize simplicity. You’d think simple would be the default. Ornate is more work. But something seems to come over people when they try to be creative. Beginning writers adopt a pompous tone that doesn’t sound anything like the way they speak. Designers trying to be artistic resort to swooshes and curlicues. Painters discover that they’re expressionists.
