Some things in an object are familiar; they constitute its generic form. Other things are rare or unique; they constitute its particular form. 

A well-known phenomenon in psychology is the cessation of full awareness of familiar stimuli. The phenomenon has been called “compiling” by Herbert A. Simon, “tacit dimensionality” by philosopher Michael Polanyi, the “ready-to-hand” by Martin Heidegger, and “driving on autopilot” in casual parlance (Ekman 2013). 

In the terms of the Russian Formalist school, it is the difference between _recognition_ and _seeing_, where to recognize is to perceive in a minimal, peripheral way. Within a [[predictive processing]] framework, we can understand this as schemas “explaining away” well-integrated stimuli. Where high-novelty information, or significant clashes between our expectations and sense data, earns more awareness in this model, low novelty or schema-congruent sensory data is allocated less space in the consciousness field. 

Carl Wilson: "Balancing repetition and novelty is crucial." 

Simon Reynolds, Red Scare intvw: "Post-punk carried on the modernist ethos of making it new, the terror, on one hand, of repeating yourself, and on the other hand, repeating others."

# The familiar

# Mere-exposure effect

From the Wiki:

> The mere-exposure effect is a psychological phenomenon by which people tend to develop a preference for things merely because they are familiar with them. In social psychology, this effect is sometimes called the familiarity principle. The effect has been demonstrated with many kinds of things, including words, Chinese characters, paintings, pictures of faces, geometric figures, and sounds.[1] In studies of interpersonal attraction, the more often someone sees a person, the more pleasing and likeable they find that person.

> Another important feature of organized activities is that they are habitual... to participate in these activities, and to do so well, that is to say, with skill or expertise, we need to relax into habits. Watch an experienced mother suckle her older infant. Each of them just sort of collapses into the familiar, almost [[ritual|ritualized]] activity.

> We are organized [neither at the level of the nervous system nor the level of conscious, deliberative action, but rather] at an intermediate level, at what the roboticist Dana Ballard has called the "embodiment level."

> Art, really, is an engagement with the ways our practices, techniques, and technologies organize us, and it is, finally, a way to understand our organization and, inevitably, to reorganize ourselves.

In this way it is a practice akin to [[defamiliarization]]: by breaking us out of the unconscious ready-to-hand, from recognition into sight proper, we get a chance to remake our organized structures.

Noë makes much of the door handle:

> For an invention such as a door handle even to come on the scene, a whole cultural and biological stage needs to be set. But once the handle does appear, the practice of using doors with handles itself recedes into the background stage setting of our lives. We rarely if ever need to stop and ask questions about door handles. Unless we are designers, we don’t think about them very often. Our attention is fixed on getting into or out of the room, on what we are doing and where we are going. Manipulating doors by their handles becomes second nature. Indeed, the handle becomes the hub of a whole little organized activity of getting around in the houses we build and the places we live. We get organized by door handles, spontaneously reaching for them, gripping them appropriately.

### On the tendency for the foreign to familiarize

> art that is very old—or from a remote culture—sometimes no longer shows up for us as challenging and difficult. This may be because it falls under the category “important art” and is brought to our attention under glass in the art archives. Or it may be that the work is unfamiliar and we don’t get what it is doing. In both cases, the works don’t engage, challenge, or affect us, which is just to say they don’t show up for us as art. Very often we find ourselves admiring old masters, for example, more or less solely for their decorative aspects, or because of their supposed historical significance or monetary value, or perhaps because they exhibit virtuosity in craftsmanship. And so of course it seems implausible that we admire works of this sort because of the way they subvert or undercut or abrogate the authority of what is normally taken for granted. After all, that’s just not what these works do for us, at least most of the time. They have expired. Or stopped being artworks. Until we learn to look again, that is.

> two paintings by Leonardo da Vinci, one a portrait of his Milanese patron Duke Ludovico’s wife and the other of his patron’s mistress. In one sense, these are just pictures of beautiful and beloved women, and Leonardo was presumably contracted to provide just that—exhibitions of these women that were at once celebrations of them. But in another sense, they are much more. It is striking that in the portrait of Duke Ludovico’s wife (La Belle Ferronnière), the subject stares straight out at us. She shows herself to us. We are given her by being given her eyes. It is also noteworthy that we cannot see her hands, which are concealed on her lap behind a low wall. In Leonardo’s portrait of the duke’s teenage mistress Cecilia Gallerani (The Lady with an Ermine), by contrast, Cecilia looks away from us. But she is not concealed. We do not see her look, but we are able to see her hand. Her right hand, with which she holds the ermine, captures attention. It is enlarged, bony, powerful, masculine, and it juts forth. It is neither an accurate depiction of a young girl’s hand nor an idealization of her beauty, or her person.

# The foreign

## Outgroup homogeneity bias

Intimacy with a domain entails the knowledge of a wide or diverse range of attributes which vary (despite, ostensibly, all members of the set having in common the domain-relevant quality). On the other hand, a lack of intimacy with a domain entails a perception of homogeneity _along the lines that constitute it as domain_, in other words, without the experience of diversity, the qualities-in-common dominate the sensory perception. 

In sociology and facial recognition, "outgroup homogeneity bias" is the phenomenon by which members of a group perceive members of an outside group to be more homogenous, and less diverse, than the group which the members are a part. In facial recognition, this is known as "cross-race effect": humans are more sensitive to differences in facial features among members of their own race, and less sensitive to differences among members of other races. This may in large part be due to exposure; since the family and local community of an individual tend to be made up of racially similar individuals, their facial recognition capacities are trained on a same-race set. At the same time, their available training data for _other_ races is much smaller in comparison than the same-race set.

On music boards, a common refrain is that reggae, or rap, or country, or metal, or ambient, or Billboard pop, "all sounds the same." That this complaint is leveled toward almost every genre is testimony to this outgroup homogeneity bias, where the ability to perceive meaningful differences among some unfamiliar domain is highly limited. In Bourdeausean terms, we can say that it is difficult to recognize meaningful moves if we are not yet familiar with the dominants of the genre, the stakes and [[the space of possibles]] its history has produced. Subversion and interrogation, so crucial to [[predictive hermeneutics]], are impossible without the assumptive landscape result from schemas built on experience. Alternatively, we might frame this as a pattern-matching instinct from humans: first we have to understand the similarities between instances which makes them a "class," in the same vein as we acquire language, and that it is this epistemic drives makes the formally generic elements of given instances more perceptually salient than the formally particular elements.

# Defamiliarization: making the familiar foreign

To the Formalists, a crucial aim of art was defamiliarization, where the everyday and banal (or “ready-to-hand,” or “pre-compiled”) is presented in a way which distorts it into newness (makes it "present-at-hand," in Heidegger's framing). Audiences appreciate a fresh sight of what was previously merely recognized. Often, the defamiliarized subject is not immediately recognizable for what it is; only when the mind connects the defamiliarly presented with the familiarly known, an analogic link is created between the two which upcycles into new models, or interpretations, of the familiar.

Perry 2016: The Theory of [[narrative]] Selection

> In the academic study of [[narrative]] selection, a popular approach has been to identify individual elements that might explain the success of particular stories. One body of research concerns minimally counterintuitive entities and elements: [[narrative]] elements that are counterintuitive enough to be interesting and memorable, but not so counterintuitive as to lose coherence (for instance, a mouse that talks, but not a mouse that talks, is 500 feet high, and can control the weather). There was even a suggestion that the ideal story has between one and three counterintuitive elements (see, e.g., Stubbersfield et al., 2013).

## [[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]] 1986: Principles for a Sociology of Cultural Works

> the impetus behind the process of "banalization" and "de-banalization" [read: [[defamiliarization]]] described by the Russian formalists is not inscribed in the works themselves but rather in the opposition between orthodoxy and heresy which is constitutive of all fields of cultural production and which takes on its paradigmatic form in the religious field. It is significant that Weber, speaking of religion, speaks also of "banalization" or "routinization" and of "de-banalization" or "de-routinization" with regard to the respective functions of priesthood and prophets. The process that carries works along is the product of the struggle among agents who, as a function of their position in the field, of their specific capital, have a stake in conservation, that is, routine and routinization, or in subversion, that is, a return to sources, to an original purity, to heretical criticism and so forth.

## Noë 2015: Strange Tools

> Art is interested in removing tools (in my extended sense) from their settings and thus in making them strange and, in making them strange, bringing out the ways and textures of the embedding that has been taken for granted.

# Familiarization: Making the foreign familiar
From Sontag, [["The Aesthetics of Silence"]]:

> For, in one of its aspects, art is a technique for focusing attention, for teaching skills of attention... The history of the arts is the discovery and formulation of a repertory of objects on which to lavish attention; one could trace exactly and in order how they eye of art has panned over our environment, "[[naming]]," making its limited selection of things which people then become aware of as significant, pleasurable, complex entities. (As Oscar Wilde pointed out, people didn't see fogs before certain 19th century poets and painters taught them how to; surely, no one saw as much of the variety and subtlety of the human face before the eras of the movies.)
