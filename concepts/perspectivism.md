_Perspectivism, like the [[Wagner 2018|reciprocity of perspectives]], is a flavor of [[generalized compatibilism]]. Where RoP belongs to the phenomenological and anthropological traditions, perspectivism (formerly "contextualism") is part of the psychological and [[meta-science|philosophy of science]] traditions._

"Everything possible to be believed is an image of truth." (William Blake)

Perspectivism is a beautiful merger of the [[pragmatism]], [[indexicality]] and post-[[logical positivism|positivism]] ideas. “If we can’t have clean concepts that carve the world at its joints, then we shouldn’t expect clean laws between those concepts, and thus shouldn’t expect contextless rules like X abstraction --> Y abstraction to exist”
