_Your ability to justify, in language, is the limit of your liberty, in society._

![[_Bureaucracy_#^f9b221]]

Justification exists in all societies, but expresses differently depending on how ossified and auto-telic the conventional norms of the society are. Where conventions are perceived, deontologically, as "proper" irrespective of outcome or the desires of the involved individuals, then justifying or "spinning" one's actions can only take the form of correcting the record of fact—to demonstrate that the admonishing or judging party, whose diminished opinion risks your social standing and its attendant benefits, has the wrong impression of _what_ you've done. In more pragmatic, pluralistic, and behaviorally free societies, modes of action are typically perceived more consequentially and relatively, with greater allowance given to good intent or misunderstanding. That is, the justifying party has a much wider array of strategies for appealing a judgment: they can illustrate how their actions do, in actuality, fulfill the spirit of pro-social behavior even as they appear to violate it; an appeal to some higher order, above mere convention, that is "value" or morality may be made.

To a great extent, communities are defined by what members are expected, and called upon, to justify. In many communities, for instance, aesthetic taste or moral judgment are considered "beyond justification." In communities organized around aesthetic taste (be in cinephiles, rockists, or museum curators) or moral taste (philosophers, the devoutly religious), however, the need to justify such decisions is constant, and defines the relevant activities: philosophers and curators, pop critics and pastors, spend a considerable amount of time building a justification structure for their beliefs and decisions. To eventually construct, over a career, a novel worldview is to some large extent to build a novel justification structure, defending new principles by the old, or replacing the old with the new.

The expectation of being asked to self-justify, and there being real social stakes in one's self-justification, is evidenced in part by common self-reports of internal monologues geared around hypothetical justification to some challenging party. These monologues are most present when an individual is actively violating some social norm, or breaking from tradition (i.e. the behavior cannot be justified socially, but must instead by first principles), or even when one realizes—retroactively—that some decision or behavior was fallible and may be challenged.

Cooperating members of a society regularly demand that fellow members justify their behaviors. This may take the form of arguing for the merits of ones occupation (e.g. in the arts, or sciences) in order to continue receiving funding (as in a grant application), or even merely gain social approbation (as in a cocktail mixer). Or, it may take the form or arguing that one's actions were—typically contra, or in the face of ambiguous, beliefs by the justified-to party—righteous. Arriving late to work, one may well be expected to justify one's tardiness by arguing that the circumstances which caused the tardiness were unusual, or could not have been anticipated and thus prevented. This is less to "rehash the past" than it is to coordinate moving forward: by claiming that an unexpected accident has caused delays in arrival, one is also implicitly promising that future arrivals will be timely (since the circumstances preventing today's timely arrival cannot be reasonably expected to reoccur). 

Justification takes different forms depending on whether it occurs in more or less "liberal" contexts and cultures. By liberal, here I mean, wrapping games, or contexts, which allow more or less behavioral leeway to participants. In a strict society (such as we think of the Victorian era), justification can only occur on the basis of facts. In a loose or liberal society (such as we think of contemporary cosmopolitan societies), justification can occur on the basis of arguing mechanisms, matters of facts. I'll explain what I mean by this.

In a society with strong etiquette norms, conventions are autotelic. If an office or workplace has strong conventions for arriving at 9am each morning, one who has been caught might give an alibi, or lie. They may even attempt to contest the basic facts that they have arrived late—perhaps they were already at the office, but left briefly to fetch something from their parked car. But they cannot explain that they have intentionally arrived at 9:30 today because they planned on staying later that night. 

In other workplaces, arriving late is acceptable so long as one also stays late, or accomplishes a similar amount of work (e.g. by skipping a lunch break, or giving extra effort). That is, what matters is pragmatic _value alignment_. Arriving at 9am is merely a means toward the greater telos of production that further's the office's goals. 

In this situation, justification can take recourse to showing how one's behavior mechanistically and pragmatically achieves some shared value or goal, even if it does not appear to at first. A police officer, releasing a criminal against protocol, will be varying able, depending on how liberal vs. conventional his department is, to justify this breach of convention on a humanitarian or strategic basis (e.g. "we will tail his car, and follow him to the money"). At the extreme end of protocol-submission and conventionalism, where the convention becomes the end in itself (and, more or less, a substitute for higher values, for which conventions would typically be an instrumental means), such a justification would be impossible, and could only take place by contesting the circumstantial facts (e.g. that protocol does in fact dictate the criminal's release, or that the prisoner was not in fact released, etc).

We see a great deal of justificatory, high-level values abstraction in the contemporary art world. In previous, more conventional regimes, certain styles or techniques were considered good in their own right, separate from a higher end. The more "open-minded" contemporary art scene does not see artistic practice this way; rather, it is open to defenses of unusual, convention-defying practices so long as it can be argued that such practices mechanically achieve some greater goal, such as the subversion of expectations, or greater political consciousness, etc.

# And strategic non-commitment

Strategic noncommitment is the idea that, in social interactions, we expect & pre-empt being bound to our words at some later date, and therefore limit the scope of commitments (either to future actions, or to current states) to keep options open—to stay empowered—if required to self-justify. This theory casts justification as a centerpiece of social life, where our leash is our ability to justify (particularly to authority figures such as bosses, teachers, police, etc—but also in general, socially).

> @natural_hazard Your ability to justify, in language, is the limit of your liberty, in society.
[7:38 PM] suspended reason: This is sorta what [[surrogation]] stuff is about, right?
[7:39 PM] suspended reason: The constant self-justification that's endemic to bureaucratic settings, or even just large superorganisms in general
[7:39 PM] suspended reason: "When man leaves the village"
[7:40 PM] suspended reason: Any time the relevant network complexity shoots up and things are no longer local and the evaluators don't intimately know the evaluated parties
[7:41 PM] suspended reason: You don't need a CV in a Dunbar-sized tribe etc
[7:43 PM] suspended reason: There's the normal, informationally rich Opticsland of IRL, repeated interaction/exposure, iterated bargaining, longterm ledgers, etc—and then the really informationally narrow, compressed bandwidth Opticsland of on-paper, one-off interactions

## 1/9/21

[6:42 AM] suspended reason: Having read the prologue/first chapter to Nature of Order this morning that seems baked-in. The "mechanistic view" of the world
[6:43 AM] suspended reason: It also ties into that conversation @lambdaphagy with Nico about taste and justifying taste, and then later at the dinner table we talked about bureaucratic justification, grantwriting and stuff
[6:44 AM] suspended reason: If you're constantly proxying for X skill with "the ability of the skill-holder to represent their skill in language," you filter out aphrasiac talents and filter in skill-less PR agents
[6:46 AM] suspended reason: That said, I think specifically in VizArts, it's not the most unwelcome thing to spend a century on a "linguistic turn"—it opened up avenues for conceptual practices and textual art that were fully blockaded pre-1900—but it seems important to at least acknowledge that trade-off, and think about how to mitigate it/what the Pareto frontier is of genres
"Justification is the leash on our liberty."
