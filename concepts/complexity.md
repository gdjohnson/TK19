# Complex system management

> On March 12, 1928, the St. Francis Dam, just north of Los Angeles, California, failed catastrophically and sent a wave of water through the valley that caused the gruesome deaths of hundreds of people. No one had predicted the disaster, but after an investigation, it was decided that the dam was built on inadequate soil; the disaster was, in theory, predictable – after the fact. People thought they had control over a massive force (the water), but their control turned out to be illusory.

> Considering political and social disasters like the famines of the Great Leap Forward in China or the French Revolution, a similar explanation for the resulting piles of bodies seems apt: social forces over which humans thought they had control (in the sense of being able to coordinate with each other for well-being and sustenance) turned out not to be under their control. 

## Overhaulism

_Overhaulism is closely related to [[intervention-on-behalf]]._

_Individual imagination is weak; evolution is strong_ (Sarah Perry).

**overhaulism** (n): related to Chesterton’s fence, [[Friedrich Hayek|Hayek]]’s “fatal conceit,” Christopher Alexander and James Scott’s “high modernism,” Taleb’s “modernistic intellectualism,” and John Gall’s “systemism.” A belief in the power of individuals’ synchronous reasoning & intelligence to intervene in a complex system; correspondingly, an attitude of bearishness toward evolved solutions. Ethical overhaulism is an arguable facet of some forms of applied utilitarianism or consequentialism (rule utilitarianism manages to avoid this trap). Overhaulism in architecture and design are fundamental aspects of modernism, for better and worse. Behavioral econ’s attempt to overhaul the evolved wisdom of local fields (e.g. [[sports|basketball]] and hot-hand fallacy) was an example of the failures of overhaulism. There are sometimes advantages to reason- and intelligence-based overhauls, specifically in getting us over valleys and onto higher local maxima, but it is weakest in dealing with systems of complexity outside our current intellectual grasp (human psychology and visual beauty, in the case of architecture and design; human performance, in the case of hot-hand; causality and nth-degree effects in the case of utilitarianisms).

### The Soviet engineering dream

Those who rallied under Lenin in the Revolution were committed to a vision of a new scientific age, and a new scientific man, which social change would usher in. Marx had discovered the scientific laws governing society, and with this knowledge, social engineering could bring about a brighter tomorrow.

In the 1920s, the engineers of the previous Tzarist regime filled the state planning committees, being the needed experts for this new society. When Stalin came to power in 1924 upon Lenin's death, he instituted the first Five Year Plan, calling for the modernization and industrialization of Russia. Millions of Russians dispersed across the country, building new cities and retrofitting the old. When the engineers began gathering and flexing their new political clout, Stalin had thousands of them tried and either executed or pushed into force labor. He began setting up engineering schools across the country, where card-carrying young Stalinists could train in engineering, replacing the old regime's technocrats.

Magnitogorsk was founded in 1929 in the southern Urals, modeled after Gary Indiana, in a push to become the largest steel producer in the world. From scratch on the steppe, and entire new city was built up.

It is important to note that this vision has more to do with a technocratic implementation of Communism than it was in Communism's spirit. David Graeber writes, in "How to change the history of the world,":

> after the French Revolution, many conservative critics held Rousseau personally responsible for the guillotine. What brought the Terror, they insisted, was precisely his naive faith in the innate goodness of humanity, and his belief that a more equal social order could simply be imagined by intellectuals and then imposed by the ‘general will’. But very few of those past figures now pilloried as romantics and utopians were really so naive. Karl Marx, for instance, held that what makes us human is our power of imaginative reflection – unlike bees, we imagine the houses we’d like to live in, and only then set about constructing them – but he also believed that one couldn’t just proceed in the same way with society, and try to impose an architect’s model. To do so would be to commit the sin of ‘utopian socialism’, for which he had nothing but contempt

### Scott: Seeing Like A State

## The ethics of coercision

David Stove, _The Plato Cult_:

> No ideal could be more destructive of human life than the ideal of non-coerciveness. A new-born human is so helpless... that it would never survive for one day if hands which are both coercive and loving did not guide to the nipple.

# Emergence

## Chalmers 2006: Strong & Weak Emergence

__strong emergence__: the "truths concerning [a high-level] phenomenon are not _deducible_ even in principle from truths in the low-evel domain"; the typical meaning in philosophical contexts.

__weak emergence__: the "truths concerning [a high-level] phenomenon are _unexpected_ given the principles governing the low-level domain"; the typical meaning in scientific and complexity studies contexts.

Strong emergence (for Chalmers, the only plausible candidate in our world is consciousness) has radical implications for our natural laws, implying their incompleteness; weak emergence does not. Weak emergence is more an observer-based classification with a "something for nothing attitude," in which complexity that is _interesting_ and _surprising_ arises from ostensible simplicity—in other words, the behavior is _unpredictable_.

As discussed in an [[inexact sciences]] reading discussion, this frame is somewhat incoherent, since strong emergence must either be in the same vein as the "supernatural"—it defies the laws of physics—or else merely defies the _known_ laws of physics, which is to say, it is as observer-dependent as weak emergence, merely a product of insufficient knowledge.

## Poincaré 1908: Science and Method

> Why have meteorologists such difficulty in predicting the weather with any certainty? Why is it that showers and even storms seem to come by chance, so that many people think it quite natural to pray for rain or fine weather, though they would consider it ridiculous to ask for an eclipse by prayer? We see that great disturbances are generally produced in regions where the atmosphere is in unstable equilibrium. The meteorologists see very well that the equilibrium is unstable, that a cyclone will be formed somewhere, but exactly where they are not in a position to say; a tenth of a degree more or less at any given point, and the cyclone will burst here and not there, and extend its ravages over districts it would otherwise have spared. If they had been aware of this tenth of a degree they could have known it beforehand, but the observations were neither sufficiently comprehensive nor sufficiently precise, and that is the reason why it all seems due to the intervention of chance.

# Friston: The mathematics of mind-time

> omplex systems are self-organising because they possess attractors. These are cycles of mutually reinforcing states that allow processes to achieve a point of stability, not by losing energy until they stop, but through what’s known as dynamic equilibrium. An intuitive example is homeostasis. If you’re startled by a predator, your heartbeat and breathing will speed up, but you’ll automatically do something to restore your cardiovascular system to a calmer state (following the so-called ‘fight or flight’ response). Any time there’s a deviation from the attractor, this triggers flows of thoughts, feelings and movements that eventually take you back to your cycle of attracting, familiar states. In humans, all the excitations of our body and brain can be described as moving towards our attractors, that is, towards our most probable states.

# Complex adaptive systems

## Holland 2012: Signals and Boundaries

> The components of a complex adaptive system are bounded subsystems (agents) that adapt or learn when they interact. Markets languages, and biologicla cells all fit the CAS framework, the agents being, respectively, buyers and sellers, speakers and proteins. 

> Adaptive agents are defined by an enclosing boundary that accepts some signals and ignores others, a "program" inside the boundary for processing and sending signals, and mechanisms for changing (adapting) this program in response to the agent's accumulating experience.

# Complexity and reduction

## Emily / aiju (@the_aiju) Jan 4

> the biggest mistake that follows from a reductionist worldview is MASSIVELY underestimating just how complex everything is

> engineering is actually prior to science, not the other way around! — forcing the world to a lower complexity using engineering is the first step to scientific discovery

> astronomy is a notable exception to this — the heavens are surprisingly low complexity from our point of view! — and unsurprisingly the earliest science to fully develop

# Three Body Problem

From Alex Boland’s “[[narrative]] Engineering”:

> Imagine a planet orbiting a star, nothing else in the picture, at all.  This is the whole universe.  Only having to take these two things into account, it’s possible to write up a mathematical equation that reliably describes their trajectory; in time, as they pull on each other, they will eventually settle on a predictable stable pattern.  Now, let’s say that planet has a moon.  Now everything goes to hell: this doesn’t just make the problem harder, it makes it literally impossible.  Poincare proved that there exists no equation to describe this situation, not least because there is no ultimately stable long-run pattern.  Eventually, even the tiniest difference in the initial positions, speeds, and masses of these celestial bodies will dramatically change the outcome, which means that even if you make a computer simulation of this, you can’t ever fully predict it because your inputs will have a finite number of digits and will have to be ever so slightly different than the actual initial conditions.
