Asymmetric justice occurs when punishment for failures is proportionally greater than rewards for equal-magnitude successes (or vice-versa).

Asymmetric justice results in the "IBM option," where employees will prefer low-risk but low-upside moves. In other words, risk aversion.

Similarly, in the [[opticratics|opticratic]] world of scientific peer review, [[Crispy Chicken]] writes:
> Most science is bad, not actively lying. The reason why it's "bad" is because the authors present their data in a way to make their results appealing, but this kind of presentation goal specifically selects against giving reviewers anything to sink their teeth into. Most reviews are pretty negative—but without concrete things to be negatie about, the person actually deciding whether the paper gets in (who is _not_ a reviewer, by the way) can't fairly pay them much heed.

Some onlookers believe that institutions today are broadly risk-averse as a result of functional asymmetric justice from lawsuits.

[[Nicholas Nassim Taleb]] writes about the other kind of asymmetric justice, in which catastrophic failures in the wake of tail risks are excused, or go unpunished, because they were "unforseeable"—e.g. post-2009 bank bailouts—which effectively subsidizes riskier behavior. Similarly, a [[short-termism]] in reward structures means a functional asymmetric justice, whereby a VP can move from company to company, with short-term profits but causing long-term problems, always staying ahead of the problems his short-term approach causes, and being rewarded via better and better positions, pay, etc for his past "successes."

See also [[Joshua Knobe]]'s Knobe Effect:
> In a study published in 2003, Knobe presented passers-by in a Manhattan park with the following scenario. The CEO of a company is sitting in his office when his Vice President of R&D comes in and says, ‘We are thinking of starting a new programme. It will help us increase profits, but it will also harm the environment.’ The CEO responds that he doesn’t care about harming the environment and just wants to make as much profit as possible. The programme is carried out, profits are made and the environment is harmed.
> Did the CEO intentionally harm the environment? The vast majority of people Knobe quizzed – 82 per cent – said he did. But what if the scenario is changed such that the word ‘harm’ is replaced with ‘help’? In this case the CEO doesn’t care about helping the environment, and still just wants to make a profit – and his actions result in both outcomes. Now faced with the question ‘Did the CEO intentionally help the environment?’, just 23 per cent of Knobe’s participants said ‘yes’ (Knobe, 2003a).
