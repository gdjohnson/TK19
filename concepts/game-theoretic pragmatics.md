# Franke 2013: Game Theoretic Pragmatics

> The general logic of a game theoretic explanation of a pragmatic phenomenon is this: (i) the conversational context is modelled as a game between speaker and hearer; (ii) an adequate solution concept then selects the to-be-explained behavior in the game model.

Franke thinks of game theory as the study of [[strategy game]]—games where player outcomes depend on the actions of other agents, and thus player decisions hinge on predictions about these future actions. He gives a simple example of a coordination game, using Wellington boots and blue suede shoes as an example, then writes:

> Telling stories, giving commands and asking questions, also listening and figuring out what Joe meant when he said ‘‘kind of’’ – all of these linguistic activities have something essential in common with the rubber-or-suede game. Here and there, several agents have to make a decision how best to act given their preferences and their expectations about the others’ behavior. As speakers we usually have a preference for getting our point across, or for persuading our hearers of our point of view. A speaker’s action choices are naturally constituted by the set of possible utterances given by our grammatical competence, or some relevant subset thereof that interlocutors commonly attend to. Hearers may seek entertainment or information.

[[Paul Grice|Grice]]'s maxims, e.g. of concision ("quantity"), fall [[Gricean maxims#^216ab7|naturally out of the pragmatic frame]]—it is less an imperative or norm, and more an expectation that emerges naturally from a desire for efficient, efficacious communication. Given this efficiency, we as listeners can assume that unnecessary information provided is "doing something"—is there for a reason—an idea that sometimes gets called [[Horn's division of pragmatic labor]].

Schelling was responsible for inspiring early game-theoretic linguistics:

> [[David Lewis]] was the first who applied game theoretic ideas to philosophical questions about language in his seminal work on convention ([[signaling game|Lewis 1969]]). Inspired by the work of [[_Strategy of Conflict_|Schelling (1960)]], Lewis tried to give a non-circular naturalistic grounding of the notion of conventional meaning in terms of repeated plays of signaling games, thus answering challenges to conventionalism put forward by, among others, [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]] (1921) and [[Willard Quine|Quine]] (1936).

Franke distinguishes between an evolutionary model of game-theoretic pragmatics, and a more rationalistic model. He then further distinguishes between evolutionary microdynamics and macrodynamics. [We might alternatively call this training process "cybernetic."](https://suspendedreason.com/2022/01/17/acim-is-a-natural-extension-of-cybernetic-theory/) Macrodynamics, meanwhile, involves preferential replication of successful strategies over successive generations—standard natural selection stuff.

Rational pragmatic language use was pioneered by [[Prashant Parkih]] in the 1990s and 2000s. Parkih advances, among other arguments, that (1) for a view of communication in which an "equilibrium between the speaker's intended meaning and the hearer's interpretation" is critical; (2) the central task of the listener, in interpreting speech, is disambiguation; (3) the speaker and hearer together construct a "game of partial information" (Parkih's update on Lewis's [[signaling game]]) In the rationalistic frame, behavioral predictions follow from an understanding of speaker beliefs, dispositions, rationality, etc. 

# Jäger 2007: Game-Theoretical Pragmatics
> In his book *Using Language* (Clark 1996), [[Herb Clark]] makes a distinction between two approaches to the psychology of language. He favors what he calls an *action approach* to language use and distinguishes it from the more traditional *product approach*. The latter line of research focuses on linguistic *structures*, the former on *processes*. Clark’s distinction is also useful when considering languages of logic and logic-based approaches to natural language. While the language-as-product perspective may represent the mainstream of the logic-and-language line of research, the procedural aspects of language have been stressed over and over again by many researchers. (It is not a coincidence that a rather influential book on logical grammar, van Benthem 1991, is titled “Language in Action”.)

From here, Jäger argues it is natural to take action as _interaction_, between agents who "have preferences regarding the outcome of their interaction"—in other words, the realm of [[strategy game]] or game theory.

> Game-theoretic semantics offers an alternative to Tarskian semantics because the meaning of a complex formula is not computed in terms of the truth conditions of its components, but with reference to the sub-games that correspond to these components.

Eventually, this line of reasoning reaches a model that approximates [[all communication is manipulation]]:

> there is another tradition of game theoretic models of communication that goes back to the work of [[signaling game|Lewis (1969)]]. Here, communication is essentially seen as an attempt of a sender to manipulate a receiver by transmitting certain signals that might influence future decisions of the receiver. If we assume that the interests of the players are common knowledge, such a manipulation will only be successful if the game is not zero-sum. (In a purely competitive game like poker, rational players are welladvised not to give away any private information by sending signals!) So in this tradition, communication is essentially seen as part of an at least partially collaborative endeavor.

Lewis 1969 proposes the _signaling game_, a frame which is then picked up by economists and biologists.

> The insight that signaling games are being played iteratively by the members of a population helps to explain how signals may acquire and sustain a conventional meaning in the first place.

> it has also frequently been observed that [[Paul Grice|Gricean]] pragmatics has a strong game-theoretic flavor because it involves strategic rationality considerations.

In this frame, "[[Nash equilibria]] establish stable meanings for _lexical items_, the smallest atoms of sentence construction."

# van Benthem 2008: "Games That Make Sense": Logic, Language, & Multi-Agent Interaction
> On the traditional view of linguists and logicians, _syntax_ is about grammatical code, _semantics_ is about mathematical relationships between syntactic code and structures in reality, while the rest of language use is the bustling but unsystematic world of _pragmatics_. In particular, on this view, meaning does not involve agency of any kind: it is a '0-agent notion.' But starting from the 1970s, another view emerged placing actions of language users at centre stage, making meaning the 'information change', or more general 'context change potential' of linguistic expressions. Speakers or writers change the information states of their hearers or readers, and semantics should describe these changes. This action and update-oriented '1-agent view' of meaning is the basis of the well-known Amsterdam paradigm of 'dynamic semantics' developed by Groenendijk, Stokhof and Veltman and their students, and also underlies the well-known** 'discourse representation theory' of Hans Kamp and Irene Heim.

This move shifts the agenda of linguistics, re-categorizing pragmatics (previously "everything else/outside") to being the focus of study, sidelining [[semantics]] (previously central) as mere means to pragmatic end. van Benthem echoes Jager 2008's story in which game-theoretic models follow naturally when one extends the "language as action" approach to "language as interaction."

# Burnett 2017: "Sociolinguistic interaction and identity construction"
> the proposal that concepts and mechanisms from game theory could be useful for analyzing language use has previously been explored by [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] ([[_Strategic Interaction_ 1|1970]]), [[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]] (1977), Myers-Scotton and Bolonyai (2001), Dror, Granot and Yaeger-Dror (2013, 2014), and Clark (2014), among others

Burnett argues the logical next step for game-theoretic pragmatics is to incorporate Bayesian game-theoretic models, which have already "become a dominant paradigm for the explanation of non-linguistic cognitive processes."

Burnett defines games as follows:
> In a nutshell, a game (as game theorists define it) is composed of two basic parts. The first component is the architecture of the situation of interaction itself: for a situation to be a game (in this technical sense), there must be at least two players. The players must interact and this interaction must result in a particular outcome which must depend on the choice of strategy of each player; that is, players’ actions have to play some role in determining what happens. Finally, each player must have a preferential ordering over outcomes: they must prefer some things to happen more than other things. The value that players assign to particular outcomes and actions is called their utility. The second crucial component to a game is the solution concept: a rule or algorithm that determines how the game is played, i.e. what actions the particular players take.

Bayesian inference is the attempt to draw a conclusion B after having observed event A—that is, _P(B|A)_—through a calculation of how likely A is to indicate B in the light of their prior belief that B is the case.

# Bidimensional Optionality Theory
BOT holds, in short, that listeners (to perform an optimal interpretation of an utterance) must consider the counterfactual—must consider alternate expressions the utterer might have used instead, drawing on theory of mind to reverse-engineer the representational motivations behind the utterance.
