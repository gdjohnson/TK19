There is a bias, in knowledge production, against statements of the obvious or commonsense, and in favor of the counter-intuitive.

Harvey Sacks:
> A curious fact becomes apparent if you look at the first paragraph – it may occur in the third paragraph—of reportedly scientific treatises back to the pre-Socratics and ending up to at least Freud. You find that they all begin by saying something like this, "About this thing I’m going to talk about, people think they know, but they don’t. Furthermore, if you tell them, it doesn’t change anything. They still walk around like they know although they are walking in a dreamworld."" Darwin begins this way; Freud begins this way… I could provide a much larger list.

[[Ethnomethodology]] is the study of common sense and the everyday stock of knowledge since it is the basis of individuals' actions, interpretations, etc. Kenneth Leiter, _Primer on Ethnomethodology_:
> Contrary to the established scientific view represented by Darwin and Freud, ethnomethodology does not begin with the assertion that what people know and use is wrong. Rather, it begins by proposing that we need to study what people know and use, commonsense knowledge, because the use of such knowledge by the members of a society produces the sociological phenomena studied by sociologists.
