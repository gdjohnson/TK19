What is that leaping sensation, that zooming out from experience and into identity, appearance, reputation? Simply, the switch from intrinsic to extrinsic.

Everything that is about other people, we call “extrinsic.” Everything that would still hold separate from others’ assessment and beliefs, we call “intrinsic.” Extrinsic value is how much you can sell an asset for. Extrinsic evaluation is opticratic: when a referee is judging whether a fencing sabre makes contact, then fencing moves which look like they make contact are as effective as those which actually do. Intrinsic value is how much an asset is valuable to you, non-fungibly. In a real duel, whether there is fog, whether there are onlookers, whether no one hears a tree in a forest—if the sword cuts your skin, the sword cuts your skin. If you are slain, you are slain. It is when we enter the social that we transition from the intrinsic to the extrinsic—a transition which enriches and impoverishes us on separate axes, simultaneous.
