Apollonius—the way a frame changes felt experience.

[[Alasdair MacIntyre]]:

> [[[Jane Austen]]'s] Emma insists on viewing her prote´ge´, Harriet, as a character in an eighteenth-century romance. She endows her, deceiving both herself and Harriet, with the conventional qualities of the heroine of such a romance. Harriet’s parentage is not known; Emma converts her into the foundling heroine of aristocratic birth so common in such romances. And she designs for Harriet precisely the happy ending of such a romance, marriage to a superior being. By the end of *Emma* Jane Austen has provided Emma with some understanding of what it was in herself that had led her not to perceive the untruthfulness of her interpretation of the world in terms of romance. Emma has become a narrative about narrative.
