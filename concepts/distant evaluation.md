"In an age when the average consumer has only the vaguest notion of the actual activities of a vast, complex corporation, the public image of the corporation substitutes for more specific or more circumstantial notions of what is going on." (Boorstin 1961)

In this sense vibes as a property of art are really similar to vibes as properties of places and people and cultures — you can be trained in early-Simpsons vibe by coming up in a Simpsons writing room in the early 90’s like you can be trained in having a Jewish vibe by growing up Jewish
