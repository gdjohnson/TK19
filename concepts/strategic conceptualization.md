__Strategic conceptualization sits at the interstice of [[framing]] problems, [[pragmatic ontology]] and [[strategic interaction]].__

When consequences are the result of categorization, people will perform categories to get their desired consequences.

Categories carry with them a mix of [[decision rules]] and connotations. Connotations, we can think of as the culturally understood value judgments, or feelings, that accompany a category. Decision rules we can think of as the domain-specific actions which are conditionally taken on the basis of whether a object or event under consideration is or isn't a member of the relevant category. In the selection games framework, we can think of them as selection conditionals: if [this category], then [that selection].

Categories are inferred from prominent public features (which themselves may be sub-categories); for instance, a customer at a store will recognize another individual as a member of category "employee" based on attire and actions. Perhaps the employee is wearing clothing whose color matches the store branding. Perhaps he appears to be "restocking the shelves" (itself a categorization based on features such as having a pallet of identical products which are being placed _onto_ the shelves instead of taken _off_ of them; here object categorization of the pallet, the products, and the temporal direction of products onto shelves are all composed of smaller inferences). These inferences, of course, are usually automatic.

Because categorizations tend to bring about certain consequences, either directly via [[decision rules]], or indirectly via the changed feelings which mission-relevant individuals may have about the categorized, interventions in this categorization process become strategic imperatives. Much of law is concerned with how established facts ought to be categorized or conceptualizedâ€”different salient details such as the mental health of the defendant, his state of mind at the time of the crime, and his history with the slain will be mobilized in support of one conceptualization or another. This conceptualization (the degree of murder, manslaughter, etc) will have a significant role on the defendant's prison sentence.

Therefore, there are two sides to the coin of gaming a decision-rule: [[signaling theory|signaling]], in which one strategically presents [[metonyms]] which imply a category; or strategic conceptualization, in which one presents the topic-at-hand (oneself, an event or object, etc) at high [[levels of abstraction]].
