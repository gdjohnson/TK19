> Humans, it turns out, are more physiologically aroused by the sound of their own voice than that of others, but unconsciously so. In a classic experiment from the late 1970s, a group of people were each asked to read the same text. The recordings were chopped into short segments and a mosaic master tape was made with snippets from different voices. The participants were then hooked up to a machine measuring their galvanic skin response, which is normally twice as high for hearing your own voice than the voice of another. Then people were played the tape and asked to press a button when they heard their own voice. While some subjects denied their own voice and others projected it onto the voice of others (claiming that someone else was actually them), in all cases the skin had it right.

Richard Alexander 1996 interview:

>  sexually reproducing organisms have different sets of genes, so they are in competition with one another reproductively. And it is not easy to imagine that they would evolve to transmit accurate information to one another.

> If there is a lot of deceit, as in human communication, the only way you can counter the deceit, is by being very good at detecting it, and then of course you have to be very good at delivering it. Put those two things together as processes that go on for thousands of generations, and you wind up with a very complicated system of communication, complicated because of the deceit. What you really have to study is honest communication; that becomes the difficult thing to explain, which is sort of counter to our own views of ourselves, which makes it even more difficult

> I once wrote that society has to be a network of lies and deception, and my gosh, everyone thought that was a horrible statement. And it is a horrible statement if you take it as a moral suggestion. But I was giving it as an analysis; we have to suppose, at the outset at least, that there is an enormous amount of deception. I always say to my students: Think of what people do early in the morning. They look in the mirror, shave or use make-up, put deodorant under their arms, use clothes that make their shape look better, and go into their office with a big smile and say "Good morning!", while they may not feel like that at all.

It is strategically advantageous to 

> Everyone wishes to have around him people who regard his interests as important as theirs. So it is in our interests to advertise our abilities and tendencies to help other people with their interests, and not to our advantage to continually advertise our selfish tendencies. This is so complex that it is almost impossible to think about. If you say to somebody: "You are evolved to reproduce, and you are not evolved to do anything else", you will get immediate bristling, and people will say: "That is not true, I am considerate of others, I am kind", and they will go through a whole litany of things which may be true in the way that they state them, but they have to always be analyzed in terms of selfishness and altruism.

# Self-deception

_You act irrespective of the truth, which remains just out of mind,, because why work to discover something that will only thwart your goals' achievement?_

Perry, "Cooperative Ignorance":

> There is a truism about scams that a mark can only be deceived if he wants to believe; all deception relies on self-deception. The ideal victim of a scam is a person who desperately wants to believe in a reality different from actual reality. Perhaps he receives no utility – or even negative utility – from the actual state of affairs. In other words, reality, such as it is, causes him pain. He is willing to risk everything on the possibility of a different reality being true, precisely because the present reality is of little use to him.

> The scammer provides a temporary service, offering for sale a plausible facsimile of a different reality. In this fantasy world, the mark gets to be rich, or loved (as in dating scams), or healthy (as in healing scams), or young (as in anti-aging products); he gets to contact his deceased relatives, or achieve spiritual transcendence or high [[status]]. What does the victim get out of it? The service the scammer provides to the mark is a plausibility structure for a desirable belief – usually only temporary.

> The problem with the scam is that it comes to an end, with the victim generally worse off than if he had never received the “service” provided by the scammer. But what if it never had to end? What if we could all scam each other, forever, to believe in a reality that is better for us than actual reality? That is the hope of cooperative ignorance.

Scott Alexander, "Trivers on Self-Deception":

> There’s some controversy over exactly how good our mental lie detectors are or can be… [There’s] evidence that there are certain people who can reliably detect lies from any source at least 80% of the time without any previous training: microexpressions expert Paul Ekman calls them (sigh…I can’t believe I have to write this) Truth Wizards, and identifies them at about one in four hundred people.

> The psychic unity of mankind should preclude the existence of a miraculous genetic ability like this in only one in four hundred people: if it’s possible, it should have achieved fixation. Ekman believes that everyone can be trained to this level of success (and has created the relevant training materials himself) but that his “wizards” achieve it naturally; perhaps because they’ve had a lot of practice. One can speculate that in an ancestral environment with a limited number of people, more face-to-face interaction and more opportunities for lying, this sort of skill might be more common; for what it’s worth, a disproportionate number of the “truth wizards” found in the study were Native Americans, though I can’t find any information about how traditional their origins were or why that should matter.

> Trivers’ theory is that the conscious/unconscious distinction is partly based around allowing people to craft narratives that paint them in a favorable light. The conscious mind gets some sanitized access to the output of the unconscious, and uses it along with its own self-serving bias to come up with a socially admirable story about its desires, emotions, and plans. The unconscious then goes and does whatever has the highest expected reward—which may be socially admirable, since social [[status]] is a reinforcer—but may not be.

> […]

> Trivers’ theory has been summed up by calling consciousness “the public relations agency of the brain”. It consists of a group of thoughts selected because they paint the thinker in a positive light, and of speech motivated in harmony with those thoughts. This ties together signaling, the many self-promotion biases that have thus far been discovered, and the increasing awareness that consciousness is more of a side office in the mind’s organizational structure than it is a decision-maker.


## Deception and consent
Whether something is honest, consensual, and good for both parties often correlate; see also [[all communication is manipulation]].

Pirates differ from business insofar as it is non-consensual due to, and resulting in, lopsided terms. (If the terms were fair, they’d be easier to secure consensually than by force.) Deceit, a kind of piracy in business, entails false advertising—that the apparent deliverable or contract did not reflect the real terms, and what was entered consensually was entered under a false appearance deliberately created by one side of the contract.
