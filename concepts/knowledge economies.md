# Intellectual Dark Matter

Phrase coined by Burja 2019 ("Intellectual Dark Matter") but idea traces at least back to [[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s "Field of Cultural Production":

> One of the major difficulties of the social history of philosophy, art or literature is that it has to reconstruct these spaces of original possibles which, because they were part of the self-evident givens of the situation, remained unremarked and are therefore unlikely to be mentioned in conte mporary accounts, chronicles or memoirs. It is difficult to conceive the vast amount of information which is linked to membership of a field and which all contemporaries immediately invest in their reading of works: information about institutions—e.g. academies, journals, magazines, galleries, publishers, etc.—and about persons, their relationships, liaisons and quarrels, information about the ideas and problems which are 'in the air' and circulate orally in [[gossip]] and rumour. (Some intellectual occupations presuppose a particular mastery of this information.) 
> ...The ordinary effects of derealization and intellectualization are intensified by the representation of philosophical activity as a summit conference between 'great philosophers'; in fact, what circulates between contemporary philosophers, or those of different epochs, are not only canonical texts, but a whole philosophical doxa carried along by intellectual rumour—labels of schools, truncated quotations, functioning as slogans in celebration or polemics—by academic routine and perhaps above all by school manuals (an unmentionable reference), which perhaps do more than anything else to constitute the '[[assumption ground|common sense]]' of an intellectual generation.

"Dark matter" circulates in the knowlede economy—information our society is founded or runs on, which is lost or hidden:

> Today we possess written fragments from only 13% of the ~2,000 ancient Greek authors known to us by name. This does not account for the authors we do not know, and only a small portion of the 13% figure consists of complete works

> Our core philosophical, political, and theological works are conceived in dialogue with Greek and Roman thought. Medieval and modern thinking so vital to the creation of our largest and most important institutions, such as that of St. Thomas Aquinas or Montesquieu, rests on the preserved works of antiquity. Those works in turn are themselves written in dialogue with further works that remain lost to us. We therefore cannot even see the intellectual foundations of our most important religious, academic, and political institutions.

And [[Sam Fussell]], writing in _Muscle_, notes, "As with steroids, the magazines avoided altogether the subject [of shaving], since it included the disturbing matter of shaving the legs. But I gathered from Mousie and Sweepea that I would need a number of blades."

## On guilds and proprietary knowledge

> the Medallion Fund managed by Renaissance Technology has returned an average of 40% annually since its inception, including a 100% return in 2008, making it by far the best-performing hedge fund in history and netting its investors tens of billions of dollars. Its mathematical underpinnings are kept secret not only via non-disclosure and non-compete agreements, but also very high compensation and a carefully crafted, unique company cultures that disincentivizes interaction with the outside world.

> Guilds also protect information through formalized training and apprenticeship. While this training may not be necessary to master the relevant skills, its first purpose is to ensure commitment from those trying to access information. One of the ways costs are imposed is through obscurantism, deliberately conveying information unclearly. By making a subject appear much more intellectually demanding than it actually is, you discourage people from attempting to learn or compete with you. The pretense of intellectual rigor allows you to overstate proprietary knowledge and thereby further increase your authority or extend it to domains beyond your expertise. The overuse of mathematics in economics is a good example of this.
>
> Law provides an example of a field where such guilds thrive in practice, if not in name. Nearly all knowledge of how to achieve favorable judicial outcomes is local and informal. Ranked in importance for judicial outcome, understanding of what will and will not be admitted in court comes first, second comes the construction of plausible legal arguments, and only third the discovery of relevant precedent cases. This first sort of information is guarded by a particular network or law firm to help secure an economic niche, hence the high degree of specialization within law. This is also why it is possible to outsource the routine and labor-intensive task of searching for favorable precedents to junior partners, assistants, and even machine learning algorithms — the firm is not seeking to protect that information.

## On the role of tacit knowledge

> The Bessemer process illustrates the critical economic value of tacit knowledge and the difficulty of making it explicit. In 1856, Henry Bessemer patented a new process for making steel that was much less expensive than existing methods. He licensed the patent to several manufacturers, but they weren’t able to get the process to work based on his explanations, and eventually sued Bessemer over it. Bessemer took matters into his own hands, started his own steel company, and implemented the process with great success.

On proprietary knowledge, and the quest for it:

> In World War II, Germany’s Wernher von Braun developed the V-2 rocket — the first guided ballistic missile — with devastating success. Neither Germany’s rivals, nor its allies possessed the technology, and Germany was sure to keep this knowledge close to its chest. As the war was ending, the SS closely guarded von Braun and his team with orders to execute them if the Allies approached. Nonetheless, the scientists managed to escape and surrender to Allied forces, after which they were immediately sent to the U.S. to train teams of American engineers and military personnel in rocketry. This was not an isolated case — the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. both carried out large special operations to capture German personnel with valuable tacit knowledge, and both benefited immensely from it.

> Lost knowledge is not just ancient. Strategic actors of the present understand the advantage of locating and revitalizing recently lost traditions of knowledge. If you aspire to build world-class rocket engines today, you might go to great depths, even deep-sea depths, to understand rocket construction during the golden age of American space exploration. In 2013, Jeff Bezos recovered two Apollo 11 rockets from the bottom of the ocean. Do you believe that he donated them to the Smithsonian without having the team at Blue Origin, his aerospace company, reverse-engineer them first?
