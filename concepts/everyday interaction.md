# Goffman 1969: Strategic Interaction

Goffman's _Strategic Interaction_ was written "in full awareness of, and to some extent inspired by, Schelling's _The Strategy of Conflict_"—while exhibiting the "dominant tendency among microsociologists to keep [[game theory]] at a distance" (Vollmer 2013). Goffman calls "strategic interaction" interaction in which, as with Schelling's definition, players' best moves are determined by fellow players' choice of moves. (_See entries on level-K thinking in [[Theory of Mind]] and [[Reflexivity]] entries._)

> Two or more parties must find themselves in a well-structured situation of mutual impingement where each party must make a move and where every possible move carries fateful implications for all of the parties. In this situation, each player must influence his own decision by his knowing that the other players are likely to try to dope out his decision in advance, and may even appreciate that he knows this is likely. Courses of action or moves will then be made in light of one's thoughts about the others' thoughts about oneself. An exchange of moves made on the basis of this kind of orientation to self and others can be called strategic interaction.

> If a subject does not know about the kinds of cues in his own situation a sophisticated observer can use as a source of information, then the subject can hardly obfuscate them (or accentuate them), were he desirous of doing so.

> As G.H. Mead has argued, when an individual considers taking a course of action, he is likely to hold off until he has imagined in his mind the consequence of his action for others involved, their likely response to this consequence, and the bearing of this response on his own designs. He then modifies his action so that it now incorporates that which he calculates will usefully modify the other's generated response. In effect, he adapts to the other's response before it has been called forth, and adapts in such a way that it never does have to be made.

Goffman's aim is "to isolate the analytical framework implied in the game perspective" by demonstrating the insufficiency of a [[game theory|game-theoretic]] framework in handling "real-life situations." Like other sociologists, he seens [[game theory]] as "unduly generalizing from the analysis of a narrow subset of social situations and as failing to understand situations within this narrow set to begin with" (Vollmer 2013). Somewhat bizarrely, Goffman dismisses [[game theory]] as focusing on zero-sum games (despite Schelling's framework explicitly focusing on mixed motives games):

> The idea of all-out, 'zero-sum,' opposition, and of a pure and tight game, does not cover all that is to be considered. And while thenotion of a game of coordination expands matters a little, too much is still left out.

In everyday interaction, players exist in an "ecological huddle" where they can monitor, observe, learn from, mirror, and dynamically adapt to one anothers' moves.

## "Expression Games"

Goffman calls "strategic interaction" the "calculative, gamelike aspects of mutual dealings." "In this paper," he writes, "I want to explore one general human capacity [...] to acquire, reveal, and conceal information."

We're in the field of optics, [[opticratics]]. Negotiating the gap between being and appearing. Goffman looks to intelligence communities, espionage theory, interrogation tactics for his answers, though we can imagine similar studies drawing on poker, warfare, business, and bargaining (that's the side of the road Schelling walked in Strategy of Conflict; the approaches are closely linked).

Goffman starts with a couple premises/carvings, and builds on them:

* Individuals "exude expressions."
* These expressions contain information.
* This information is "discursive" in the sense that it "pertains to the general relationship of that individual to what is transpiring" around him, i.e., to use Garfinkel's term, it's indexical: meaning is "bound to context."
* All interactions with individuals carry some information, but "face-to-face interaction has a special place because whenever an individual can be observed directly, a multitude of good sources of expressed information become available."

### Communication vs Expression

Much like ethology distinguishes between [[signalingTheory|signals and cues]]—one strategic & intentional, the other unintentional—Goffman distinguishes between _communicated information_ and _expressed information_. If a signal is a songbird proclaiming his presence, a cue is the rustle of branches as he takes flight. To the observer, both events are sources of information, but to the emitter, only the former was desired to be communicated. (The emitter would rather hide his cues, and not rustle the branches, but the branch-rustling is a side-effect of movement. At best, emitted cues tend to be harmless; at worst, they're fatal. There's a conflation here of "benefit" with "intent," since the two naturally couple in systems of natural selection, but they aren't necessarily bound together in human domains—teasing that apart is a project for another post.) Anyway, so it is with Goffman. In expressed information, like a cue, "the generating of expression and hence making its information available is not an official end of the action but (at least ostensibly) only a side effect." Whereas communicated information involves "the intentional transmission of information."

Goffman sees personal style as a major source, for observers, of both intentional signals and unwitting cues:

> Discursive statements seem inevitably to manifest a style of some kind, and can never apparently be entirely free of "egocentric particulars" and other context-tied meanings. Even a written text examined in terms of the semantic meaning of the sentences can be examined for expression that derives from the way a given meaning is styled and patterned, as when _Izvestia_ and _Pravda_ are read by our intelligent people "symptomatically," for what the Russians do not know they are exuding through the print.

While all expression contains some trace of style, it is face-to-face expression in particular that is most rich in information.

### Types of moves

In these expression games, where an observer attempts to extract reliable information from a subject, and the subject attempts to manipulate or mask that information, there are several types of moves.

First, an _unwitting move_: "the subject's observable behavior is unoriented to the assessment an observer might be making." Second, a _control move_: "the intentional effort of an informant to produce expressions that he thinks will improve his situation," of which one kind is a "covering move."

On the observer's end, he may or may not perceive the subject's move as "naive," that is, as unwitting. If he perceives it as not being naive, that is, as being a control move, he may make an _uncovering_ move.

Control moves are made through theory of mind calculations: "the subject turns on himself and from the point of view of the observer perceives his own activity in order to exert control over it" (_cf_ Rochat's _Others in Mind_). This Goffman calls *impression management*.

Goffman goes on to differentiate between other deceptive moves and strategies, drawing on espionage theory. _Overt_ secret ops admit their general agenda, but conceal the details. _Covert_ ops carry on under a false cover agenda. _Clandestine_ ops are totally hidden from view; their mere fact is concealed. Furthermore, there is a distinction between a _feint_, when one fakes a course of action, and a _feign_, when one fakes a belief, attitude, or preference.

> Of the 50 American buyers at the Pitti Palace show of spring fashions, several admitted off the record that they never clap for the haute couture creations they like best. They don't want their competitors to know what they will order. At the same time, these buyers confessed, they applauded enthusiastically for sportswear, boutique items, and gowns that they wouldn't consider featuring in their own stores.

### Communication as predictive manipulation

Goffman has a proto-[[predictive processing]] view of behavior, intelligence, and optimization, in accord with the view of [[intelligence as futures optimization|mutual modeling of futures]]:

> All organisms after their fashion make use of information collected from their immediate environment so as to respond effectively to what is going on around them and to what is likely to occur.

And as it is in observers' interests to seek out information and act on its basis, it is in observed agents' interest to manipulate the information observers pick up, so as to bring about their own best interests:
> Just as it can be assumed that it is in the interests of the observer to acquire information from a subject, so it is in the interests of the subject to appreciate that this is occurring and to control and manage the information the observer obtains; for in this way the subject can influence in his own favor responses to a situation which includes himself."

(In a phrase, "[[All communication is manipulation]].")

This capacity is the capacity to "inhibit and fabricate expression"; it is exacerbated in "situations where an observer is dependent on what he can learn from a subject, there being no sufficient alternate sources of info." When evaluation bottlenecks on self-report, the observer is in trouble. "A contest over assessment occurs"; the interrogator/observer wishes to get the "truth," at least relevant to his ends, while the interrogated subject wishes for his own optimal outcome. (Which IMO can be meaningfully conceptualized as selection or non-selection.) Goffman, following [[ethnomethodology]], calls subjects' self-representing communications "accounts" or "explanations"—tellings meant to alter the assessment an observer would otherwise make. Accounts can be produced spontaneously or in response to questioning, and either voluntarily or under pressure.

### Identity tags

One system we have for preventing false accounts by malicious actors Goffman calls "identity tags." I've talked before about names, [[reputation|reputational]] ledgers, social security numbers, and credit scores as systems of tracking historical defection/cooperation behavior. Similarly, Goffman writes, these tags are "officially recognized seals which bond an individual to his biography"; they are "an admission that an expression game is being played, and that through identification devices the person who would misrepresent himself will be defeated." 

In espionage, "pocket litter"—objects like pens, notes, billfolds, etc—are one means of verifying identities of foreign spies. But more subtle tests like questioning about biographical info and local lore, a subject's sense of fashion and orientation to local context, etc can constitute identity tags/tests.

> Natives never appreciate how well-trained they are in the arts of detection until they find an alien among themselves who is trying to pass. Then, ways of doing things that had always been taking for granted stand out by virtue of the presence of someone who is inadvertently doing the same things differently, as when milk is put in a cup before the tea, or the numeral four is written with a crossbar, or pie eaten from the apex, not the side.

Tarantino fans, of course, will recognize an _Inglorious Basterds_ scene in this description: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_lq2p7-p2Y. Subtle differences in gesture are the [[metonyms]] which give away the whole interpretation ("not from around here").

What are natives doing, in such a situation? They are separating the real from the fake, the realities from the appearances, the actuals from the imposters. (They will inevitably lean on [[surrogation|surrogates]].)

## Strategic Interaction

> Wherever students of the human scene have considered the dealings individuals have considered the dealings individuals have with one another, the issue of calculation has arisen: When a respectable motive is given for action, are we to suspect an ulterior one? When an individual supports a promise or threat with a convincing display of emotional expression, are we to believe him? When an individual seems carried away by feeling, is he intentionally acting this way in order to create an effect?

This strategic self-interest, Goffman writes, is "one sense in which an actor is said to be rational." The strategic situation does not take many assumptions to emerge—"Once nature, self-interest, and an intelligent opponent are assumed, nothing else need be; strategic interaction follows."

### Strategic entities and qualities

Goffman carves up four entities in strategic interaction:
1. PARTY: "something with a unitary interest to promote"
2. COALITION: 2+ parties united in provisional common interest
3. PLAYER: works on behalf of a party or coalition, which is often himself
4. PAWN: a player whose own welfare is placed in jeopardy by the interests of playing parties

Players have:
1. Operational codes (their orientation to gaming)
2. Normative constraints (self-imposed moral conditions for achieving goals)
3. Styles of play
4. Informational states (what they know relevant to situation at-hand)
5. Resources and capacities (what they can do relevant to situation at-hand)

...and some of the skills that make "quality gamesmen" include the ability to:
1. Pass up [[short-termism|short-term]] incentives for long-term payoff
2. Parse information effectively
3. Simulate moves (predictively)
4. Act under pressure and set aside personal feelings

Finally, this player and his interaction have a _position_, the intersection of historic moves and enabled, possible future moves.

### Moves, constraints, and the problem of dishonesty

Players can make _conditional_ and _unconditional_ avowals (e.g. "I will X if you Y," or just "I will X irrespective of your move"). These avowals are assessed based on _[[reputation|credibility]]_, a composite evaluation of the avower's sincerity, resolve, and capacity to follow through. This is different, Goffman stresses, from "trust," which he sees as a moral concept covering sincerity and resolve alone. But, just as crucial in a strategic assessment is, separate from whether a party _believes_ or _intended_ to follow through on a promise, whether they successfully can.

"It is in the nature of words," Goffman writes, "that it will always be physically possible to employ them unbelievingly. Schelling in _Strategy of Conflict_ concurs: Players negotiating amidst play "have no way to persuade each other that they mean what they say, except by showing it in the way that they play." (And even here, there is the n-1 problem in [[game theory]], where in iterated games cooperating players are incentivized to begin defecting near the final turns.)

How then do we convince others to believe us? It appears that we constantly make decisions based on others' words, and take others' words at least provisionally at face value. How does this work? In Goffman's phrasing, "since words can be faked, what grounds can self-respecting players have for putting faith in any of them?" 

There are several answers Goffman proposes. First, he proposes that many of the situations in which we *appear* to make high-cost decisions on words alone, we in fact do nothing of the sort. For instance, in auctions, we _appear_ to take individual bids at face value, and to make decisions based on them. But, with closer inspection, we come to realize that, in fact, nothing material is bought or sold in this process by words alone. The top bidder has merely won the _right_ to purchase the item at the bid price. Similarly, in brokerage, if a client puts in an order for a stock over the telephone, a broker can "trustingly" put in the order for the stock, using the brokerage firm's funds, because the greatest risk is that the stock is re-sold a few days later, after non-payment, and the aggregate financial risk of such transactions is negligible. The client has not bought the stock verbally so much as they've verbally ordered the option to buy the stock from the brokerage firm. Goffman:

> Verbal communication in the absence of a normative basis for trust ought to be possible whenever the speaker can show the listener that there is relatively little to lose in crediting his words—a reduction of the need for trust by a reduction of what is trusted.

(Sidenote: it's very weird he uses "trust" here instead of "credibility"; it seems to contradict his previous distinction.)

A second, somewhat less obvious case in which individuals can take communications at face value is any situation in which both parties are playing a purely coordinative (to Schelling, fixed-ratio, variable sum) game. All harms and benefits are shared equally among participants. Importantly, the activity must not merely by purely coordinative, but there must be _common knowledge_ that it is purely coordinative, so that each party is not suspicious of the other's intentions or understanding—so that each knows that the other knows that each knows cooperation is in their rational self-interest.

Finally, there are iterated games. You build [[reputation|reputational]] credit in order to keep playing. Deception is against your own self-interest because, if uncovered, you will be excluded from the game. Intriguingly, Goffman notes that, in the standard game theoretic picture, rationally self-interested actors would "build up these trust credits until a time is found when the stakes are such as to make it worthwhile to expend all one's credits in a very profitable betrayal of one's world." And yet few, in reality, behave this way—cash in. Why? One answer I've come up with is the mythological concept of legacy after death.

## Intrinsic vs Extrinsic Payoffs

The big distinction Goffman brings up here is games with "intrinsic" payoffs and games with "extrinsic" payoffs. 

Intrinsic payoffs are when 
> the course of action taken and the administration of losses and gains in consequence of play are part of the same seamless situation, much as in duels of honor, where the success of the swordsman's lunge and the administration of an injury are part of a single whole.

This is in contrast to socially mediated systems of extrinsic payoff.

> A clear hit in mortal swordplay can perfectly well occur in a foggy night, the clarity of the hit having to do with its psychological consequence for the hit organism. But in games where hits are merely points, a move must often be terminated with an act of perceptual clarity, lest there be a dispute as to what, actually, happened.

Wherever "enforcement is part of implacable nature, cheating is not possible—it is not even thinkable. But where judges have to attend to points, trickery of various kinds will always be possible." 

Thus, we might speculate, as practices and games are increasingly social, and less natural, they become more [[opticratics|opticratic]].

But furthermore, in socially mediated games, words can be binding in a way that they are not with unmediated games. "Once social agencies are introduced as enforcers, it is relatively easy to support spoken statements as moves." This is the realm of performative utterances (see [[Language]]) sub-entry on performativity for full context). 

# Hendrik Vollmer 2013: What kind of game is everyday interaction?

Everyday interaction, most substantially, can be described as "a game of tacit coordination among players maintaining expectations." 

> ...the "effective cooperation in maintaining expectations" pictured by Goffman (1983) is associated not only with the overall stability of the "interaction order," but also with questions of individual and collective efficiency, and with persistent inequalities sustained among participants of everyday interaction.

Vollmer presents a picture of Garfinkel and Goffman's 1960s work as missing the ball on the true nature of tacit coordination and mixed-motive games—misunderstanding Schelling's work by taking the overly narrow view of games that had dominated [[game theory]] previous to Schelling. He cites contemporary authors, like James Coleman (1968) and Jessie Bernard (1965), as predicting that a "social-interactionist school" defined by the "convergence between [[game theory]] and sociology with Goffman and Schelling as 'the meeting point'"—and yet, such a convergence was "left unexplored by Goffman, and since by many other students of everyday interaction." 

## The tacit nature of everyday coordination

The crucial insight of Goffman and Garfinkel is that coordination is performed tacitly: "participants go along with events and activities but do not explicitly negotiate what it is they are going along with.... participants rarely, if ever, disclose their interests, motives, preferences, or utilities explicitly in the coordination of expectations: participants may talk a great deal about all sorts of things but, as Garfinkel's famous breaching experiments (1967) very effectively demonstrate, they generally do not like to talk about what they are talking about."

Coordination games are often characterized by "payoff distributions in which players are rewarded for making moves that in some sense match," e.g. the battle of the sexes, or stag hunting, or even a [[game theory|prisoner's dilemma]]. Because humans are skilled at mirroring, mimicry, and social learning, some of the best-accessible equilibria those in which a joining player, by copying existing players' practices, will enter into an equilibrium. This has been called by Ken Binmore "Nash's categorical imperative": to "adopt strategies that will lead to equilibrium selection if they are adopted by others" (Vollmer 2013).

(Other types of coordination games reach their most efficient equilibria through "complementary rather than identical moves," in the spirit of "a division of labor.")

How do members learn to tacitly coordinate, and maintain congenial expectations? Through an "attunement" to one anothers "full bodily and somatic presence," subtle cues of affirmation, surprise, confusion, disappointment, etc. (The "surprising ability of humans to read each other" [Pentland 2008] and perform face-work, as explored by Rochat, Tomasello and many other thinkers.)

> Learning emerges from tacit coordination because, very generally speaking, the confirmation of expectations is pleasant and the frustration of expectations is unpleasant. Powerful emotions such as shame and embarrassment are involved in acquiring socially appropriate expectations and respective preferences. Rather than a list of verbally formulated expectations or definitions of situations that players would memorize, the general result is a habitualized feeling of appropriateness (Bourdieu 1990). Tacit coordination, by virtue of of keeping appropriateness mostly implicit rather than making it an issue of conversation, will tend to result in knowledge that is common among participants but at the same time to a large extent tacit.

This is the famous "taken-for-grantedness of sociality reality that is at the centre of the famous essay by Berger and Luckmann ([_The Social Construction of Reality_] 1966)." 

Given this tacit nature, and the principle of affirmations, we should expect an abundance of inefficient or Pareto-dominated equilibria:

> Since the less efficient outcome is still better than other outcomes that a player could achieve given the other player's choices, Pareto-dominated coordination equilibria will often be stable Nash equilibria—breaking down only if both players simultaneously switched to the more favourable coordination equilibrium.

That is, we should expect situations in which Pareto improvement is possible—or, in other words, we are often stuck on local maxima, with higher peaks reachable only by a coordinated switch. "Given that coordination is tacit, not only will by definition any first move away from a given equilibrium imply a loss of utility, but also players cannot be certain that an alternative equilibrium will even exist." We might call this a leap of faith—you leave one equilibrium and model another, taking a personal utility loss (from the forfeited coordination) and hoping that others will join  you, for an eventual, collective utility gain. In this frame, we can see disagreeableness as helping dicover better equilibria, and agreeableness as helping settle at all. There may even be evolutionary superior distributions, in a population, of agreeable or disagreeable personalities; these personality inclinations can to some extent be considered "strategic," and might emerge or be exacerbated by environmental requirements or niche occupation. 

What are the benefits of tacit coordination? For one, the endless "et cetera clause" specification of [[spirit vs letter|spirit into letter]] is a logistical nightmare. Tacit expectations also provide leeway or maneuvering room for participants on both sides of a tacit "contract." Further,

> The strongest case for principles of affirmation as efficient orientations for gaining utility from maintaining expectations though may perhaps be provided by the observation that, while the confirmation of expectations may sometimes be a private affair of checking ideas and sometimes an institutional affair of applying collectively ratified rules, the utility gained from entertaining them appears to be particularly high if they are collectively ratified among co-present participants. This observation is central to Randall Collins' Neo-Durkheimian understanding of interaction ritual as a process in which the entrainment of participants into patterns of physical interaction with a mutual focus is in itself rewarding, and a superior source of emotional energy.

Here, it is [[ritual]] "solidarity" and [[alignment]] themselves which become the object, and utility payoff, of the tacit game of ritual "in which participants attune to another's faces, eyes, gestures, limbs, and very minute details of their encounter in coordinating expectations."

## The emergence of conventionalism

> ...a likely outcome of the repeated run of tacit coordination games within a collective [is] that certain solutions to coordination problems are learned thoroughly and become routines which, at the same time, remain to some extent tacit, beyond reflection or deliberate modification. 

This repeated run of tacit coordination problems leads to a construction of norms, or [[social reality]]. Individuals in a community "train" one another socially, and settle on "focal points that become conventional." Schelling 1960:

> The force of many rules of etiquette and social restrain, including some (like the rule against ending a sentence with a proposition) that have been divested of their relevance and authority, seems to depend on their having become "solutions" to a coordination game: everyone expects everyone to expect everyone to expect observance, so that nonobservance carries the pain of conspicuousness.

This, as Schelling notes, helps maintain an organizational culture over its Ship-of-Theseus lifespan. Just as the planks of the ship, one-by-one replaced, are fitted into the holes and structure of the whole, the system of norms inducts new members into its logic; these new members go on, once trained, to uphold many of the same norms and values as previous generations' members.

Further, Vollmer notes, strategic situations are experienced as "stressful, risky, and forbidding" for many players involved. Conventional [[ritual|rituals]] and agreements, which can become taboo (i.e. reputationally damaging) to break in favor, are one way of lowering the cognitive and temporal overhead of doing business.

## Exile vs belonging

> the repeated run of tacit coordination within a collective will favour a distribution of expectations that makes defection less likely by segregating populations into cooperators and defectors.

Here we see much of the role of "coordinative credit" and reputational systems of vouching, or symbolic [[capital]]. We also have a justification for systems of imprisonment or exile. 

Societies in which defection is few and far between can be considered high-trust societies, and are able to coordinate more effectively to greater collective utility. 

> learning will over time cluster participants who are able to confirm each other's expectations, establishing segments in a collective in which tacit cooperation can be run in a manner allowing for some fluctuation as long as participants are drawn from the same segment... conventions can arise that are universal within the segment.

This further promises that "more deliberate forms of coordination that rely on the relative predictability of expectations and activities become available within the segment by virtue of the mere fact of stimulus generalization: by reliably motivating specific moves, certain stimuli acquire the quality of [[signalingTheory|signals]], and thus present additional leverage for coordination."

## The Simon and Garfinkel principle

Randall Collins (2004) calls "the tendency among participants to do 'being ordinary'" (Vollmer 2013) the Simon & Garfinkel principle, after Herbert Simon's "principle of affirmation" and Garfinkel's finding that "the most important 'ethnomethods' are to avoid raising questions," and to assume the normalcy of appearances or engage in "[[ritual]] repairs" when this normalcy breaks down. It is the mandate to "accept anything that is taking place as normal and ordinary as long as you can bear to do so and contribute to maintaining this normality" (Vollmer 2013).

> This principle of affirmation can be considered as a straightforward application of what Alfred Schutz (1964) has famously called the "natural attitude" of everyday life, an attitude of playing along so that "any key that is mutually recognized as the key becomes _the_ key" (Schelling 1960). 

Such players, Schutz writes, are "not interested in finding out whether this world really does exist or whether it is merely a coherent system of consistent appearances" (_cf._ [[opticratics]] and [[social reality]]).

## When does coordination become explicit?

Coordination becomes explicit only when tacit coordination breaks down. People tend to find processes of explicit coordination, and communication of internal desires or agendas, a painful and cognitively taxing process, avoiding it wherever possible.

> social situations in which explicit forms of coordination are prevalent is constituted by instances in which breakdowns of coordination have occurred, and these situations illustrate particularly well participants' preference for tacit coordination

Explicit negotiation, as demonstrated in the results of (e.g.) Garfinkel's breaching experiments, proved to be "stressful, risky, and forbidding" to players.

### Garfinkel's "et cetera" clause

However, it appears that no explicit coordination is purely explicit; tacit coordination is required "to put explicit agreements into effect," because even explicit contractual terms are [[fuzzy]] and ambiguous. Garfinkel (1967) calls this the "et cetera clause," and writes:

> No matter how specific the terms of common understandings may be—a contract may be considered the prototype—they attain the status of an agreement only insofar as the stipulated conditions carry along an unspoken but understood _et cetera_ clause [...] Therefore it is both misleading and incorrect to think of an agreement as an actuarial device whereby persons are enabled as of any Here and Now to predict each other's future activities. More accurately, common understandings that have been formulated under the rule of an agreement are used by persons to normalize whatever their actual activities turn out to be.

Vollmer writes:

> Garfinkel's comments on the 'et cetera clause" indicate the general character of tacit coordination in following not only agreements, but also any type of rule: if a rule were to spell out all cases of its future application, it would lose its general character and lead to monstrous specifications of rules about the rules for the rules of using rules... any rule able to coordinate participants' moves (whether implicit or explicit) requires a community of players trained in applying the rule. [_In other words, rules are inherently [[fuzzy]]; see also [[Spirit Vs Letter]] entry._]

Continuing along the lines of the et cetera clause, Vollmer argues that a "completely explicit," non-[[fuzzy]] form coordination in which "participants [are] able to give signals that would unambiguously specifiy which moves to make," is impossible:

> While there are many requests that participants of everyday interaction consider to be as explicit as they may possibly be ("kiss me," "pass me the ball," "show me your ID," etc), such perceptions of explicitness come by virtue of participants being well-trained members of the same collective.

Finally:

> Sending coordinating signals that are explicit enough "for all practical purposes" and being content to receive them is an articulation of the "et cetera clause," and it implicitly signals a general willingness to work out the specifics of any direction, plea or order, in tacit coordination.

## Doing "being sociable"

Vollmer expands on Georg Simmel's 1950 work on sociability, where certain topics are avoided, and "participants' attention is drawn away from long-term convictions or commitments," avoiding model conflict and focusing instead on areas of anticipated model agreement (e.g. opinions on weather, common sentiments in the workforce or [[fields|field]], etc).

> The effort to be sociable will restrain participants from introducing into an encounter anything that might be divisive with respect to the solidarity in play, and while they will certainly have serious longer-term commitment and convictions to live up to, and may know or guess each other's to some extent, participants will generally tacitly avoid them.

> Not every encounter, of course, is sociable in this manner, but, like doing being ordinary, doing being sociable will provide players with an orientation of how to go along, allowing others to go along, of how to join an engagement from outside the initial ecological huddle and allowing others to do the same.

## Disappointment as surprisal, and the costly epistemic arrangements of groupthink

Vollman refers to "disappointments" where Friston or Clark might say "surprisal," e.g.:

> While a tendency to be extra careful not to offset "current interaction arrangements" is one way of keeping coordination in equilibrium in the face of potential [predictive] disappointments, another is to cultivate expectations that tolerate a wide variety of events and activities.

Vollman writes that, while members of an organization or subculture in which "an unlikely version of normality is projected from precedence" will "face increased risk of being [predictively] disappointed by divergent moves," this risk may "ironically... back up the stability of coordination equilibria once participants realize the initial vulnerability of expectations and will accordingly be particularly careful not to offset them, as in groupthink dynamics." In other words, it is costly to maintain such beliefs, requiring the subject to actively avoid outsiders (whose models will differ, thus upsetting their own models), or to avoid reality-testing behavior, etc.

# Mutual prediction & sociality

_See [[Legibility]] and [[Intelligence as Futures Optimization]], specifically on mutual future modeling and self-legibilization in mixed-motive games._

Individuals “actively constrain their own behaviours so as to make themselves more easily predictable by other agents.” (Andy Clark, _Surfing Uncertainty_). This is typically referred to as “prosocial” behavior; unpredictable action is usually perceived as hostile or aggressive, which is part of the Asperberger’s stigma (a failure not just to model another mind but to incorporate its model of you into behavior).

Sontag, "[[The Aesthetics of Silence]]," on the power dynamics of asymmetric [[legibility]] or illegibility:

> For a person to become silent is to become opaque for the other; somebody's silence opens up an array of possibilities for interpreting that silence, for imputing speech to it. The ways in which this opaqueness induces anxiety, spiritual vertigo, is the theme of Bergman's _Persona_. The theme is reinforced by the two principal attributions one is invited to make of the actress' deliberate silence. considered as a decision relating to herself, it is apparently the way she has chosen to give form to the wish for ethical purity; but it is also, as behavior, a means of power, a species of sadism, a virtually inviolable position of strength from which to manipulate and confound her nurse-companion, who is charged with the burden of talking. (See also the opacity and reticence [[cool]].)

# Ethnomethods as strategies

## Neyland 2018: Garfinkel on Strategy

> Take a simple example like a cough. A cough can of course be merely a physiological response to needing to clear one’s throat, but it can also be a social method (an ‘ethno-method’) for, say, signalling disagreement, displaying scepticism about an account, interrupting someone, or signalling that someone is blocking your path. The answer to the question of precisely which of these various ‘senses’ of the cough applies on any given occasion is generated by the stock of social knowledge (Schutz, 1967: 80) that competent members of a social group use to ‘recognise’ its meaning in that context. For example, members may have knowledge that, in particular situations, coughs that are particularly elongated, particularly short, particularly over-dramatised, or accompanied by a ‘roll of the eyes’ signal that that cough is not just ‘clearing the throat’ but has a different social meaning.

## Agre 2985: The Structure of Everyday Life

> I'd go in, I'd get the teabag and put it in the cup, I'd get out the kettle and fill it with water, and I'd put it on the stove. And one day while I was doing all this it occurred to me that I should be putting the water on the stove first and getting the other things out afterward. The next time I went into make tea, I went straight for the kettle, filled it, and put it on the stove. But then I thought hang on, this is an electric stove. The next time out I turned on the electric stove before filling the kettle... waiting for water to boil and waiting for an electric stove to heat up are notorious hassles. By putting names to hassles, you provide yourself with a way of noticing that something is more trouble than it ought to be.
