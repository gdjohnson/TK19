# Perry 2015: An Ecology of Beauty and Strong Drink

*On the sensory exploitation hypothesis:*

> A less well-known possibility [as alternative to the handicap principle], surprising in its arbitrariness, is the sensory exploitation or sensory bias hypothesis: that traits evolved to capitalize on some pre-existing sensory capacity for pleasure and beauty. Under this framework, animals have built-in sensory and discriminatory capacity – that is, aesthetic capacity. This capacity is then exploited in sexual selection, directing the color, sound, shape, and other features of sexual displays. Frog calls evolve not to signal any particular adaptive trait, but to optimally stimulate frog hearing organs; guppies get orange spots because the fruit they like is orange. Female wolf spiders like leg tufts on male wolf spiders because they look cool, even if their species hasn’t yet evolved them.

> In differential sexual selection theory, animals (such as fruit flies) display genetic variation in female choosiness: some females are aesthetes and will only mate with ideal males; others are philistines and will mate with any vaguely suitable male. When a species lands in a pristine, unexploited environment for the first time, the population is small; choosiness is a hindrance and will be selected against. Only promiscuous philistine females will get a chance to mate. As a side effect, combinations of genes that would never take place under choosiness occur; as the population increases, so does genetic and phenotypic variation. This provides ample variation for aesthetic selection to work on, and aesthete females then have room to reemerge.

*On empty niches:*

> In biology as well as economics, any empty niche is crying out to be filled, and will be filled by the best thing available, in context. Australia made wolves out of marsupials. Islands make land predators out of crabs, grazers out of parrots, and tree dwellers out of kangaroos and skinks. Whoever shows up, gets a job, regardless of whether they are well-suited to it by millions of years of evolution. In the case of fruit flies, they get many jobs, taking over insect duties at many elevations and environments that would, on the mainland, be performed by insects with a longer niche-specific adaptation history.

*On clearcuts:*

> When a mature natural ecosystem is destroyed by fire, clearcutting, or plowing, a particular process of succession follows. First, plants with a short life history that specialize in colonization emerge; these first-stage plants are often called weeds, or “weedy ephemerals,” and make up a large number of agricultural pest species. But these initial colonizers specialize in colonization at the expense of long-term competitiveness for light. Second, a wave of plants that are not as good at spreading their seed, but a little better at monopolizing light, gain dominance. These are followed by plants that are even better at long-term competition; eventually, absent human interference, the original weeds become rare.
> 
> Sometimes, however, the landscape is frozen at the first stage of succession; this is known as agriculture. Second-wave competitive plants are prevented from growing; the land is cleared again and again, and the seeds of a single species planted, providing an optimal environment for short-life-history weeds. Since the survival of humans and their livestock depends on only a few species of plants, other plants that would eventually out-compete the weeds must not be permitted to grow. Instead, herbicides are applied, resulting in selection for better and better weeds.

# Eno on Ecology, for Edge.org

Ecology has "made commonplace and intuitive a type of perception that used to be the province of mystics—the sense of wholeness and interconnectedness," Eno writes. And in this connection to mysticism, a sea of discourse emerges: the psychedelic realm of hyperconnectivity and ego-death, its association with Asian mysticism and the ying/yang symbols, the reciprocity of perspectives.

> Beginning with Copernicus, our picture of a semi-divine humankind perfectly located at the centre of The Universe began to falter: we discovered that we live on a small planet circling a medium sized star at the edge of an average galaxy. And then, following Darwin, we stopped being able to locate ourselves at the centre of life. Darwin gave us a matrix upon which we could locate life in all its forms: and the shocking news was that we weren't at the centre of that either—just another species in the innumerable panoply of species, inseprably woven into the whole fabric (and not an indispensable part of it either). We have been cut down to size, but at the same time, we have discovered ourselves to be part of the most unimaginably vast and beautiful drama called life.

Where before, Eno writes, we understood the world in "the metaphor of a pyramid," a hierarchy "with God at the top" and all information flowing downhill, ecology reframes this vision into a decentralized, cybernetic, "complex weblike system." Information runs in all directions; "instead of a single hierarchy we see an infinite of nested-together and co-dependent hierarchies... the dense field of intersecting intelligences."

In the ecological frame, we resituate "genius" as the product and mask of "scenius"—a collective intelligence which history's great men have mined, managed, and merged (see also [[cultural evolution]]: "Individual imagination is weak; evolution is strong."). Great men are a medium, a vessel—not for a deity, in the traditional sense of artisans—but for their _ecology_, the temporally and spatially distributed—but here gathered, reconciled, reconsidered in one space. Paglia calls this "schlepping" in the "cancelled" preface to _Sexual Personae_:

![[_Sexual Personae_#^a9c06d]]

An early example of this ecological thinking—though Eno doesn't acknowledge it—is the market, with its "standpoint epistemology" of prices (_cf._ the work of Matthew McKeever) and its "invisible hand." Where the market is, at least in ideal form, a kind of decentralized system of desires and capacities, where each individual's representation of his own desire and capacity informs his interaction with the whole, command-style economies (and command-style hierarchies generally, such as those common of the pre-modern military) and potentially disastrous. Unable to receive feedback from observers on the ground, and weak to cronyism, cowardice, and the arbitrary tyranny or emotion of powerful men, command-style efforts at centralized systematicity usually fail [[overhaulism]]-style due to an inability to handle the [[complexity]] of the task-at-hand. Similarly, democratic government systems are an attempt at a "marketplace" of ideas and local self-governance; information and intelligence flow not just top-down but bottom-up, and states serve as the "laboratory of democracy"—a testing ground of individual initiative, to be imitated by other states should the initiative prove fruitful.

# Ecological morality: the art of [[game theory]]

If we deprioritize the subject, and emphasize the ecology, then what we are left with is a system of intersections, interdependencies, systems in need of equilibria—coordination games. This offers a potential _foundation_, in the Arendt sense of [[authority]], which is more-or-less objective and absolute, and manages to transcend individual petty interest.

# The reciprocity of perspectives

## Merleau Ponty "The Intertwining/The Chiasm"

In European philosophy, a dualism, and specifically an ego-centric dualism, reigns between world and self, from the humanist to the solipsist traditions. We can see this in the sensibilities of European vs East Asian painters of the second millennium: in the former, people are front and center; in the latter, they are dominated by the landscape. 

Merleau-Ponty wants to get a handle on, or overcome this dualism, which is both an "epistemological and anthropoligical problem." The reconciliation of dualism he calls "chiasmatic." __Mind__ & __body__, __perception__ & __interrogation__, __subject__ & __object__, __self__ & __world__ are some of the chiasmically intertwined dualisms.

It's much easier to call for, and applaud, the sentiment of non-dualism, and much more difficult to accomplish it. Merleau-Ponty cannot complete his project (dies of lung cancer) and his work is only an "outline," and attempt "to catch sight of this strange domain which interrogation gives access." This essay is less an appearance of resolution—instead of methodology, he gives us poetry, an aesthetic resolution through recognition.

Merleau-Ponty stresses that we can must attend to experience, and specifically, to the _wishes of the thing interrogated_, rather than our own wishes, in order to step outside ourselves. We get a sense that objects have something to "tell" us, which is sentimentalism but also perhaps helpful: "I sometimes wonder if the forest is looking at me as much as I am looking at the forest." 
* This is approaching the _reciprocity of perspectives_ so foundational for Wagner, who himself uses "chiasmatic" frequently, and is clearly Merleau-Ponty-inspired; [[Kenneth Liberman|Liberman]] & Ponty term this "reversibility."
* When [[Kenneth Liberman|Liberman]] takes people backpacking, the first three days "they don't experience anything but their own minds"; at some point, the location (nature) "starts training them in the temporality of that location." The nature takes over the [[agency]], and the individuals adapt.
* One steel-man for this sentimentality: stressing bottom-up receptivity over top-down imposition and interrogation.

## From anthropocentrism to ecology: the evolution of concepts

Many concepts originate as _humanist_, anthropocentric ideas: the way that the world manifests _to us_. But as the phenomenon is investigated, generalized, and extrapolated from—as it is rigorized into a scientific, rather than folk concept—a different, more human-neutral perspective emerges. From Widen & Russell 2010, "Descriptive and Prescriptive Definitions of Emotion":

> Science often begins with everyday concepts and assumptions (plane geometry was based on the assumption that the earth is flat). As science progresses, however, the original concepts and assumptions can change or even disappear. For example, when ancient people exerted force, they felt muscular strain as they pushed or pulled. This feeling of strain was central to the concept of force in ancient physics. Jammer (1957) described the slow and jagged path that the concept of force traveled from its origin in everyday thought through a series of scientific proposals and then to its role in modern physics. Over that history, the word force covered a variety of phenomena, and some theorists called for abandoning the concept. In modern science, force remains, but is understood in a way qualitatively different from its origin. A different fate is seen in the concept of constellation. When ancient people in different parts of the world looked at the night sky, they saw constellations of stars. Early astronomers studied constellations, and the concept of a constellation remained central to astronomy for centuries. But, constellation is not a scientific concept in modern astronomy.

To take the latter example, a constellation is a pattern of stars _as it appears to humans on the planet Earth_, and as it is interpreted within an anthropocentric framework. This has nothing to do with the reality of stars _as it appears from the perspective of the star_. Nothing about its origins or existence are affected by either human gaze or culture; rather, the position in Earth's sky is a miniscule slice of its manifestation in the universe, with one-way causality. And yet the anthropocentric bias leads us to such a conception of stars.

## Haiku & non-dualism

One emphasis in haiku is transcending the subject-object divide. From _Yasuda: Japanese Haiku, Its Essential Nature and History_:

> Here the question arises as to the nature of the aesthetic experience, which has been characterized above as being among other things, single minded. By this, I meant: that during such an experience the observer has no awareness of himself as separate from what he sees or hears, from what he is experiencing. As he contemplates and experiences, he becomes submerged in the object, there comes in Coleridge’s phrase “a coalescence of subject and object” into one. As Otsuji has said, then “consciousness is completely unified” and “the poet’s nature and environment are one.”
> 
> John Dewey has called this state the “common pattern of experience: The outline of the common pattern [of experience] is set by the fact that every experience is the result of interaction between a live creature and some aspect of the world in which he lives.”
> 
> Otsuji has expressed almost the identical thought, indicating that the immediate experience is the aesthetic experience: “At the instant when our mental activity almost merges into an unconscious state--- i.e., the relationship between the subject and object is forgotten--- we can experience the most aesthetic moment. This is, what is implied when it is said, that one goes into the heart of created things and becomes one with nature.”
> 
> The “form of direct experience” is the realization of what the object is, in its unity and oneness, in and for itself.
