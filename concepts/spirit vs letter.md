Spirit takes many forms—rarely can we establish its exact throughlines; we may recognize when we see it, but only in person, in the fullness of its situation.

Letter—the specification of spirit—can attempt to capture some of the shapes and guises in which spirit manifests. Though this translation process cannot succeed in full, spirit on its own cannot be legislated, cannot be uniformly instituted as expectation, cannot tile itself across a superorganism.^[Cooperative enterprises organized by prestige economies to a common purpose (Simler 2016).] Insofar as it can, it is hard and unaccountable, relies on trust and discretion, defies monitor. So we are stuck with letter.

Insofar as letter invariably fails to capture spirit, each rounding off and uncovered patch of ground, each poor synopsis or compression, shifts the behavior of the organization or individual away from their desired spirit, toward some other, emergent, perverse nonintention. Often in this process, the substitution of letter for spirit is forgotten—there is a slow forgetting that something complex and extraverbal has been surrogated into language, into measurement, into specification, and the [[surrogation|surrogate]] comes to stand in as _spirit itself_. This process is known as [[surrogation]].

In the story of King Midas, Dionysus promises the king any wish he desires, and Midas wishes that all he touch turn instantly to gold. We know what he "really" was after—voluntarism, for one—but did he even know, precisely, what he wanted when he wished it? Had he specified its parameters and constraints, or assumed a human audience would infer the spirit of his desire? Unfortunately, the total space of intelligence is much broader than the space of human minds: Midas was met only by a trickster god, and his sloppy presentation of spirit into letter became the undoing by which he is known.

# Instituting spirit

Rules, as we will see, do not rid us of the *spirit* of behavior so much as its letter of expression—what we can call a desire and its outlet. Like the problem in artificial intelligence of the "[nearest unblocked strategy](https://arbital.com/p/nearest_unblocked/)," the values and intentions which gave rise to a now-banned behavior do not disappear on its banning. (Nor, technically speaking, does the banned behavior itself, which has merely had its cost-benefit equation altered to _decrease_ instances.) Instead, these desires have merely been re-channeled into the "nearest unblocked" action.

We can see this in the West's ongoing drug war, and the explosion of "research chemicals" in the 2000s and 2010s. These chemicals are called _analogues_ because they are "off-by-one"—near-copies that evade the law's letter even as they deliver similar effects, defying its spirit.

Unfortunately, writing laws based on spirit is intractable; it must be converted to letter, as the spirit depends on interpretation, and is therefore difficult to evaluate. In this sense, letter laws are _formalizing reductions_ which, in their lossy compression, gain only the advantage of minimizing vagueness. In this way they are very similar to job performance metrics or the grade-point average: their major benefit is evading vagueness, but the vagueness has not disappeared from reality, it has merely disappeared from the evaluation. Moreover, the necessity of converting spirit into letter in institutional structures, in order to coordinate superorganisms, gives rise to problems like [[surrogation|Goodhart's Law]] and [[surrogation]]. Spirit is abandoned, and letter becomes the incentive structure (or "reward function") that governs actor behavior.

One does, occasionally, see spirit-based enforcement—parents and children are an obvious case—but these instances typically require authoritarianism, a dictator who has “authority” in interpreting both the law’s spirit and the accordance of a subject’s actions with it. Such decisions need not be publicly legible, consistent, or fair—in part because they are often enacted on small populations, and in part because the authority does not answer to the public.

# Evolving spirits and underspecification
From Mannheim's "Overpowered metrics eat underspecified goals":

> As Moravec’s Paradox would have it, goal setting is so easy, we have no idea how to do it. That means that people do it unconsciously, and formalizing it into a organizational system is hard. In fact, **most organizations, especially ineffective ones, are run like a game of Calvinball; “you make up the rules as you go”.** They change arbitrarily based on the whims of those in control, and not everyone needs to agree to them.
> The problem here is that decision theory starts from a point fairly far along in the decision process. For it to be useful, you need to have a clear idea of what the rules are, and what your goals are, before you can start. Without that clear idea, even if we can list all the choices, even the trivial part of picking the best option is a mess.
> Life is a human-complete problem, [[_Finite And Infinite Games_|where specifying the goals and rules fully is part of the game]], and the goals are constantly evolving.

# Rules lawyering

### Rules Lawyering

"Rules lawyer" is a pejorative term from online RPG communities referring to those who leverage the letter against the spirit for personal advancement.

The Zeroth Rule, in wargaming, warns explicitly against letter-following:

-   1980's Basic D&D rulebook: Anything in this booklet (and other D&D booklets) should be thought of as changeable—anything, that is, that the DM thinks should be changed... The purpose of these 'rules' is to provide guidelines that enable you to play and have fun, so don't feel absolutely bound to them."
-   D&D 3.5 Player's Handbook: "Good players will always recognize that you have ultimate authority over the game mechanics, even superseding something in a rulebook."
-   Warhammer 40,000 8th ed: "In a game as detailed and wide-ranging as Warhammer 40,000, there may be times when you are not sure exactly how to resolve a situation that has come up during play. When this happens, have a quick chat with your opponent and apply the solution that make the most sense to both of you (or seems the most fun!)."

Note the [[instrumentalism]]. The rules serve the spirit (fun) of the game, and when followed to the letter, defeat the spirit.

# Affordances of Spirit/Letter Gaps

Paying lip service (observing technicalities or 'letter' while ignoring spirit) is an excellent way to defy regulations while altering norms (see how smutty mags and movies in the 1920s got around censors, slowing shifting the Overton window of normality).

# Commonplace

Venkatesh Rao, "The Gervais Principle pt II":

> So effective Sociopaths stick with steadfast discipline to the letter of the law, internal and external, because the stupidest way to trip yourself up is in the realm of rules where the Clueless and Losers get to be judges and jury members. What they violate is its spirit, by taking advantage of its ambiguities. Whether this makes them evil or good depends on the situation.
