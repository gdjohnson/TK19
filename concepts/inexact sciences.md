# Unintegrated parts

## Bourdieu 1991: Language & Symbolic Power

> Sociology can free itself from all the forms of domination which linguistics and its concepts still exercise today over the social sciences only by bringing to light the operations of object construction through which this science was established, and the social conditions of the production and circulation of its fundamental concepts.

## Chapman: Going down on the phenomenon

> Francis Bacon, the ideological founder of modern science, constructed an extensive and explicit analogy between science and rape. Nature is a woman whom the boldly masculine scientist forces to yield her secrets by sexual domination.

> Feminist philosophers of science, such as Evelyn Fox Keller, have suggested that many scientists still see their work this way. They argue that, besides being icky, this approach is unlikely to lead to good science, for the same reason it is unlikely to lead to good sex. One may achieve domination over nature (as indeed we partly have) but one is unlikely to achieve understanding, respect, or (most importantly) delight.

> Keller suggests that alternative sexual metaphors are possible. We can not only deconstruct but supplant the Baconian system. Her contribution is the notion of “wet data.” She suggests that the term “hard data” has an obvious underlying sexual sense. Hard data are worshiped by many scientists. As hard as possible: you want to force out of the instrument every decimal place you can get. More interesting, she thinks, are wet data: ones that may be preliminary but lead in intriguing, if perhaps still ambiguous, directions.

> One must be willing to approach the phenomenon it on its own terms, and one must also honor one’s personal and quirky way of working. Neither of these is encouraged by contemporary scientific ideology. To give good head you must not lean too heavily on what you already know. Every woman is different, and different each time. An attitude of “I’m going to make you come because I have great technique” is very similar to “I’m going to make this experiment work because I am so brilliant,” and neither works well.]

## Chapman on Reasonableness

_Chapman: In the cells of the eggplant_:

> In everyday usage, “rational” has an informal meaning of “thinking and acting in ways that make sense and are likely to work.” In this sense, “rational” is synonymous with “sensible.” It means “not stupid, crazy, or meaningless.” I will call this reasonableness, reserving “rationality” for systematic methods.6

> Much of The Eggplant is about the relationship between these two. Understanding that relationship is a prerequisite for meta-rationality. Rationalism misunderstands reasonableness as a primitive approximation to rationality. In fact, it has somewhat different—though overlapping—functions. “Mere” reasonableness addresses the nebulosity of the everyday world effectively, which formal rationality can’t. Meta-rationality combines resources from reasonableness and rationality, plus ones of its own, to understand and act effectively in circumstances the others cannot manage.

## Chapman (forthcoming): In the cells of the eggplant

> As always when something is a prerequisite for itself, you have to proceed in a spiral. An approximate understanding of a small part of the subject makes it possible to grasp more of it, and thereby to revise your understanding of the initial beachhead. You need repeated passes over the topic, in increasing breadth and depth, to master it.

## Austin 1962: How to do things with words

> What I shall have to say here is neither difficult nor contentious; the only merit I should like to claim for it is that of being true, at least in parts. The phenomenon to be discussed is very widespread and obvious, and it cannot fail to have been already noticed, at least here and there, by others. Yet I have not found attention paid to it specifically.

## Alan Kay

Kay argues you can't just have a single "team" of startup-like driven folk—you need a full league to compete against, the Lakers can't become a great [[sports|basketball]] team alone.

## Luigi Perissinotto 2003: Wittgenstein and Plato

Quoting [[Wittgenstein]] in _Blue Book_:

> Philosophers constantly see the method of science before their eyes, and are irresistibly tempted to ask and answer questions in the way science does. This tendency is the real source of metaphysics, and leads the philosopher into complete darkness.

Perissinotto reflects:

> From this perspective metaphysics is philosophy that models itself on science and that shares with science what [[Wittgenstein]] calls "the craving for generality" (or "I could also have said, _the contemptuous attitude towards the particular case_"). In any event, we cannot but note that, for Wittgenstein, the roots of this "craving for generality" are to be found, long before the method of modern science, in Plato, who constantly, in his dialogues, and in _Theaetetus_ in particular, "dismisses as irrelevant the concrete cases": "When [[Socrates]] asks the question 'What is knowledge?' he does not even regard it as a _preliminary_ answer to enumerate cases of knowledge."

# Engineering and applied sciences

@the_aiju, Twitter Jan 4 2021: "engineering is actually prior to science, not the other way around! — forcing the world to a lower complexity using engineering is the first step to scientific discovery"

Daniel Kahneman: Introduction to Gary Klein:

> In the US, the word "applied" tends to diminish anything academic it touches. Add the word to the name of any academic discipline, from mathematics and statistics to psychology, and you find lowered status.  The attitude changed briefly during World War II, when the best academic psychologists rolled up their sleeves to contribute to the war effort. I believe it was not an accident that the 15 years following the war were among the most productive in the history of the discipline.  Old methods were discarded, old methodological taboos were dropped, and common sense prevailed over stale theoretical disputes.

# Methodologies of the Inexact Sciences

"The problems, being existential, are universal; their solutions, being human, are diverse ... The road to the grand abstractions of science winds through a thicket of singular facts." (Geertz, _The Interpretation of Cultures_)

## 210626 TIS Transcript

[2:25 PM] suspended reason: Undervalued Methodologies in the Inexact Sciences:
1. Stamp collection
2. Defamiliarization
3. Comedy
4. Cultural criticism ("artifact processing")
[2:26 PM] suspended reason: Stamp collection is just an attempt to gather a large database of examples in order to understand the breadth of possibility, which dynamics meaningfully vary, etc. You need to do a lot of stamp collecting in biology to get to a theory of evolution
[2:27 PM] suspended reason: Defamiliarization is in the name—making the familiar foreign. "Ready to hand" --> "present at hand," to Heidegger, or recognition --> perception for the Russian formalists
[2:31 PM] suspended reason: There are a few kinds of defamiliarization I've seen... don't have a good taxonomy yet, and some of these might be compressed or carved up better, but—
1. anthropologizing, e.g. that essay on the "Nacirema" ("American" spelled backwards)
2. historicizing, which is to say, writing about the present as if it were the past
3. subjectivizing, where you present the thing through the eyes of someone who processes it very differently than yourself
4. surrealism/magical realism, where dynamics are distorted or exaggerated in symbolically truthful ways
5. closely related to surrealism, allegorization, where everyday life gets figuratively translated into a fantasy or sci-fi world
6. re-framing—any reconceptualization of a domain typically presented in a familiar frame
[2:32 PM] suspended reason: An additional approach I haven't seen yet, but wanna try my hand at, is writing about the present as if it were the science fiction of the past
[2:33 PM] suspended reason: Cultural criticism, aka "artifact processing"—similar in some respects to stamp collecting, except it's the decomposition and analysis of some dense set of examples to understand how their dynamics interweave. Some people have called literature "applied philosophy"; here, you're basically trying to reverse-engineer the theory from its application, or at least, understood how the theory is contextualized.
[2:34 PM] suspended reason: Comedy, parody, etc—I probably have the least to say about this, but often comedy defamiliarizes. It's also good at pointing out flaws in people's models pretty efficiently
