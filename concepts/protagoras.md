# Likeness, the gods, and the good

All things are like other things in some way:

> justice has some resemblance to holiness; for anything in the world has some sort of resemblance to any other thing. Thus there is a point in which white resembles black, and hard soft, and so with all the other things which are regarded as most opposed to each other; and the things which we spoke of before as having different faculties and not being of the same kind as each other—the parts of the face—these in some sense resemble one another and are of like sort.

The "good" is definited teleologically by its benefit relative to some entity, and as an organism like a human being has many constituent "subentities," a thing may be "good" relative to one and not the other:

> Do you mean, Protagoras, I asked, things that are profitable to no human being, or things not profitable in any way at all? Can you call such things as these good? By no means, he replied; but I know a number of things that are unprofitable to men, namely, foods, drinks, drugs, and countless others, and some that are profitable; some that are neither one nor the other to men, but are one or the other to horses; and some that are profitable only to cattle, or again to dogs; some also that are not profitable to any of those, but are to trees; and some that are good for the roots of a tree, but bad for its shoots—such as dung, which is a good thing when applied to the roots of all plants, whereas if you chose to cast it on the young twigs and branches, it will ruin all. And oil too is utterly bad for all plants, and most deadly for the hair of all animals save that of man, while to the hair of man it is helpful, as also to the rest of his body. The good is such an elusive and diverse thing that in this instance it is good for the outward parts of man's body, but at the same time as bad as can be for the inward.

On the gods:

> concerning the gods I am not in a position to know either that (or how) they are or that (or how) they are not, or what they are like in appearance; for there are many things that prevent knowledge, the obscurity of the matter and the brevity of human life.

Some tellings of Protagoras's life end with his conviction for impiety: the burning of his books and his death at sea, the symbolic evisceration of his philosophy.

# Relativism

Protagoras appears, based on the representation of Plato, to have advocated a kind of weaks relativism, quipping, "man is the measure of all things" (_Truth or The Overthrowers_). Rejecting an "absolute" grounding in some reality "beyond" our world of sensory appearances, Protagoras instead insisted that concepts such as "the good" were dependent on, or ultimately grounded in, culture and instrumental ("teleological") service. His belief that some beliefs were superior to others on the basis of the satisfaction they grant their holders, Protagoras anticipates the ideas of [[William James]] in "The Will to Believe." 

## Rowett 2004: Relativism in Plato's Protagoras

> When [[Socrates]] invokes these contextual variables, he is typically urging that there _must be something else_, some non-relative standard or archetype or definition that avoids the slippery relativity of particulars that seem _f_ or not-_f_ depending on other factors than their own properties. This leads to the idea that ‘the _f_ itself’ is unchanging and does not lose its sense depending on how you look at it. Socrates is concerned to explain and preserve the objective meaning of words, the objective truth of values such as goodness and beauty, and objective standards of justice, equality and virtue, despite the puzzles about Cambridge change and shifting appearances. Socrates is not a relativist because he _is not content to think_ that relative truths are all the truths there are.

> Protagoras, by contrast, seems to think that relative truths are all there are. When he points out that cases of justice or good or similarity are always relative to purpose or context, he means that there is no escape to an absolute standard of good, as opposed to good for someone, for something, for some species, etc.

## The argument against Protagoras as relativist

Richard Bett sees Protagoras as not a relativist "in any deep or interesting sense." Protagoras only becomes a relativist in relation to Plato's philosophy of moral truth as being "robustly objective," as existing as some absolute form in the beyond.
