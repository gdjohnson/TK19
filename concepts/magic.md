Honor Levy, _Ket Patrol_: " I believe the Internet can summon demons. Chaos magic is not something to be messed with, and it's kinda scary."

@exGenesis has called magic "subtle communication."

Magic is the exception to the Litany of Gendlin.

# Allgebrah, "Meme Magic"
> Science tries to describe without influencing the subject. Experiments, once set up, must work independently from theories, the map must be causally downstream from the territory. This Must becomes an expectation and creates a blind spot. But only the most well-behaved fields really work this way: Sociology and Psychology that deal with social realities struggle with this, especially. For many areas of interest, the map is carved into the territory by its usage, a herbivore trail both formed by and forming the territory. Language, world views, even our memories are such maps, changing whenever they're used.

> [Magic] is tricking reality into seeing patterns in the noise, telling it a story so compelling that it adapts.

> The web connects all the minds and a pluralistic, often split-brained shared mindspace emerges. Every sentence modifies someone's personal reality, our every word has consequences. In this environment, memes and hyperstitions thrive and a magical world view becomes viable again.

> Meme magic is supercharged pragmatics.

> In a world where memes are literally traded on currency exchanges, where you can crash a plane with no survivors, make the city of Agloe appear or America great again, whether you call it self-fulfilling prophecy or hyperstitional manipulation of desire's puppet-strings, meme magic is real, hyperreal.

> Where the Logos is the guiding principle of reality, the Mythologos is the guiding narrative... Where it used to take a state to implant collective memories and suppress others, successful memes can now achieve the same with negligible human effort, spreading through wishful thinking and toxoplasmatically along ideological fault lines.

 > So [as a journalist in the 2010s] you’re not getting paid, and you need to, you know, create clickbait. And you only have a finite amount of time to research. So people will go on social media, specifically Tumblr, and Reddit, and scrapes for stories. And what’s really interesting is this actually, this was actually documented that this was happening, and that this was creating a narrative, they were imposing narrative layers on communities that had not existed, but through the amplification cycle. So let’s say like BuzzFeed posts something, and then it gets picked up by, let’s say, The Washington Post, and then it moves a next layer up, which is like CNN, or MSNBC. And then it draws more attention to a community that might have been like really small, and it creates a new community that is divorced from the original community that had this narrative layer imposed on it. It’s kind of like a game of telephone, telephone. And there’s tons of examples of this. The one that was documented in a really interesting way was foamies, which are people who are kind of like fans of the Aurora, Colorado shooter, I believe it happened in 2012. And basically what happened was a new cycle invented that there was these teen girls who were like, really into the sky. But really, it was a joke that was construed as a truth, but because it was reported on it became real. And then there’s just like, you know, dozens of examples of this happening. Another really interesting one that I actually wrote about in college was this, this fandom, or you know, the purported fandom around the Boston Marathon bombers. That was another thing that was willed into existence by journalists.
