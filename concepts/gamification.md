# Gamification

intentional gamification: the use of a game-like structure to motivate behavior in non-game activities (e.g. the FitBit's gamification of exercise)

accidental gamification: the unintended introduction of game-like features into activities

> academic life has recently come to be ruled by quantified metrics for research quality—like citation rates and impact factors. These metrics may not have explicitly been designed to produce gamification among researchers. Conceivably, they arose from the bureaucratic need to collate information, or in university administrators' quest to make more object-sounding decisions about faculty hiring and promotion. But the clear, simple, and quantified nature of such metrics can foster game-like motivation... We could be drawn to redefine our notion of success in the newly clear terms specified by those metrics.

# Value capture

_Value capture is Nguyen's factoring of [[Goodhart's Law]], with the additional step of actors internalizing the measures rather than merely optimizing toward them._

> Value capture occurs when: 1. Our values are, at first, rich and subtle. 2. We encounter simplified (often quantified) versions of those values. 3. Those simplified versions take the place of our richer values in our reasoning and motivation. 4. Our lives get worse.

> by simplifying the specification of the target, we may bring outselves to pursue, with ever more ferver and ferocity, the wrong target.

> Such measures are useful, but we must always recall that they are merely abbreviations—usefully portable simplifications of something larger and subtler. But when our values are captured, we are motivationally caught by a simplified measure.


# Simplification of values in institutional settings

> large-scale institutions often need quantified measures of their various functionings for management purposes. High-level administrators in large institutions need to be able to compare, say, productivity, customer satisfaction, and worker satisfaction across various departments. This requires quantified representations of values. An administrator might first need to aggregate productivity numbers across different departments in, say, their Tokyo and Los Angeles locations, or aggregate productivity numbers from all locations to compare institutional productivity over years.
