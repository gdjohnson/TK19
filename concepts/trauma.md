In response to Freddie DeBoer's piece on trauma culture:

[11:58 AM] Natural Hazard: Yo, @suspended reason  is this what you have in mind sometimes when trauma comes up? https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/trauma-memes-are-dangerous
Trauma Memes Are Dangerous
medical problems require medical solutions

[11:59 AM] suspended reason: Sure, in part
[11:59 AM] Natural Hazard: If so, allow me to bask in forgetting what [unknown large percentage of people who use certain Language] are like
[11:59 AM] suspended reason: Having read my share of Bronte and Austen novels I know how destructive their pop psychology theories were
[12:00 PM] suspended reason: Confining people to bed rest and isolation for depression e.g.
[12:00 PM] suspended reason: So any pop psychology fad that seems to cause short term suffering under the guise of long term improvement I am predisposed to be skeptical toward

[5:13 PM] Natural Hazard: Trying to articulate what exactly is wrong with this orientation to trauma/healing/the self etc.  From what I can see, the biggest problem is that it's not that much "about" trauma. It's "about"  blame shame and responsibility.
[5:16 PM] Natural Hazard: It seems like the degree to which this space is "about" trauma is the proliferation of the idea that "stuff from the past still affects you, and you need to process it" but I expect that talking to these people wouldn't result in learning much about what processing is, what sorts of events do and don't "stick around" and a whole bunch of other things
[5:16 PM] Natural Hazard: Basically, id guess that it's lacking almost all of the praxis of healing
[5:19 PM] Natural Hazard: It seems like the language of trauma and healing for them is mainly a vehicle for trying to effect how they and others feel blame/shame/responsibility.
[5:20 PM] Natural Hazard: And it also seems to tackle that via trying to create social affordances do feel those differently
[5:21 PM] Natural Hazard: As opposed to a more self transformational approach where you explore the mechanisms in your mind that generate feelings of blame and shame and rework those. Again, a domain with lots of praxis that exists out there, but it's unclear if it's present here.
[5:22 PM] Natural Hazard: This cluster seems less "here's how to unhook your mind from social machinery" and more "we will reshape the social so that staying hooked in doesn't hurt as much"

[7:03 AM] suspended reason: I'm gonna go ahead and call this the dominant ideology of our age
[7:03 AM] suspended reason: I'm also gonna go ahead and say it's wrong
[7:04 AM] suspended reason: Why do I think it's dominant? Because it's the plot of every single Marvel Comics blockbuster. Every single one.
[7:05 AM] suspended reason: Black Panther, Thor Ragnarok, Endgame, Winter Soldier—heroes with buried memories, with traumatic memories they must face before they can beat the bad guy, or familial traumas they must mend in order to come into full strength
[7:06 AM] suspended reason: Cultures with sins that always come back to haunt them
[7:06 AM] suspended reason: Norse Gods with Daddy issues
[7:08 AM] suspended reason: The key to these films, ideologically, is a single dialogue line repeated ad nauseam across the franchise: "And who are you?" the villain snarls, the hero in his death grip. The hero is choking, he can't get the words out, his eyes roll back into his head, the spirits of his ancestors dance in front of his eyes
[7:08 AM] suspended reason: "I... Am...." (It is like a pregnancy labor) "Thor Ragnarok!"
[7:09 AM] suspended reason: Cue a momentous escape from the villain's clutches, a quick 180 jump-kick to the jaw, the villain banhammered into dust

[7:10 AM] suspended reason: Here's just one of a hundred examples, the proclamation comes two minutes in
[7:11 AM] suspended reason: There are two big takeaways I see as dominant ideology: one, your identity is your power, two, your trauma is your weakness but if you heal it it will become part of your identity and this amplify your strength
[7:12 AM] Natural Hazard: Interesting, does it feel fair to call it "The past is present"? I see the similarities in the examples you give, and the similarities also seem to entirely abstract away from saying what part of the past is here, and how exactly is it present.
[7:12 AM] suspended reason:

[7:13 AM] suspended reason: I think it's sorta fair, but it goes beyond that: there is an Oedipal logic. You cannot run from your past, you can only face it
[7:14 AM] suspended reason:
 “I’ve been fighting with one hand tied behind my back. But what happens when I’m finally set free?” Carol Danvers (Brie Larson) asks, before blasting the daylights out of her enemies to the tune of No Doubt’s “Just A Girl.” She’s finally unleashing her full powers after spending most of the movie struggling to come to terms with who she is—and what she’s capable of.
[7:14 AM] suspended reason:
I recognized Danvers’ unbridled euphoria at shedding trauma-induced self-doubt and finding her strength, and was so excited to it represented on the big screen
[7:15 AM] Natural Hazard: Ties in very nicely to "literal super powers I'm temporarily unable to use"
[7:15 AM] Natural Hazard: No need to actually explore what changes when XYZ particular thing in your life :smiling_face_with_tear:
[7:15 AM] Natural Hazard: (thor)
[7:17 AM] Natural Hazard: "The past is present and must be confronted" where the most important thing is this overarching vibe dynamic
[7:19 AM] Natural Hazard: And MCU let's us fill in easy examples of "past" "is present" and "confront" that only reinforce the vibe but don't shed light in particulars, because it's not too often that a friend of mine from 50 years ago will pop up as an assassin, that my sister will break into this dimension and try to destroy the world, or that the thing I need to confront is a person by punching them
[7:20 AM] Natural Hazard: I'm with you in seeing this overall arc
[7:20 AM] Natural Hazard: I'd have to think more to see if I'd consider it dominant as opposed to a common among several, but seems v plausible
