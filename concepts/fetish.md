Some principles become "fetishized"—they undergo a transformation from consequentialist instrument, or useful heuristic, to deontological imperative (as it is with Kantian honesty). A more game-like approach takes certain principles to be provisional deontologies—that is, acknowledging that their social body has come to fetishize certain styles of behavior or sets of action-reaction (stimulus-response) patterns as inherently ethical or inherently preferable. The gameplayer recognizes how important kinds of reputation and credibility are, and the consequences of breaking fetishized principles, and acts accordingly but provisionally.

As circumstances drift, or in situations the heuristic is not well-equipped to properly handle (as is inevitable and definitional to heuristics), the principle continues to be applied even as it has poor "fit" (pragmatically-functionally) with the circumstance.

This process of fetishization occurs in metrics and symbols as well, since metrics and symbols are heuristics for decision-making; one frame is to call this [[surrogation]]. These fetishized heuristics become [[surrogation|surrogate]] values, displacing one's real preferences, interests, and desires (the realm of the clueless).

[[Sam Fussell]] on fetish as life-denying:

> My lifting was life-denying rather than life-affirming. It didn't have to be lifting or muscles, of course. It could have been tax law or eighteenth-century English literature or arbitrage—anything where the obsession precluded all else. I was as twisted, warped and stilted as a bonsai tree. Another of life's miniatures.

Sam began lifting to lose his fear; at some point, the singular logic of building takes over, becomes his ends rather than his means. Instead of the hard problem of solving the holistic "bravery" issue, he gets lost in a single, value-clear reward function, with quickly diminishing returns to the larger bravery goal.
