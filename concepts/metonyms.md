Ortiz, _Strong Magic_:

> In the heyday of the big con in this country, professional con men would often meet some wealthy businessman and, within a couple of hours, succeed in convincing him, without any collateral, to turn over large sums of money to them. These well educated and highly intelligent businessmen were wiling to put their trust in complete strangers in large part because the con men were able to convince their victims, purely through their dress, grooming, and demeanor, that they were the same type of men as themselves and therefor trustworthy. These con men know that all of us draw firm conclusions about others based purely on what we see.

The best way to understand metonyms may be via [[information theory]] and posterior probability (similar to abduction and [[inference]]). Maybe there's some role for continental "difference" to match up with information-theoretic "distinction."

[9:26 AM] suspended reason: Do you think it's fair to say that signs n symbols are just cultural technologies built on top of metonymic inference?
[9:27 AM] suspended reason: If I think of symbols in [[surrogation]] terms, or just evolutionary biology terms, I think of things like the color red as a symbol of danger
[9:27 AM] suspended reason: Subject to all the frequency-dependent pressures as any other self-identification
[2:27 PM] crispy_chicken: couldn’t have put it better myself
[2:28 PM] crispy_chicken: metonymy seems to be this very basic pattern that’s used everywhere but has a lot of aspects that can be studies in generality, I want to dig into it more
[2:29 PM] crispy_chicken: also, [[surrogation]] is a result of a very salient aspect of metonymy: information lossyness
2:37 PM] suspended reason: yeah, when the metonym is rewarded, the metonym becomes the point
[2:38 PM] suspended reason: there's natural informational lossyness—edgecases, exceptions, etc
[2:38 PM] suspended reason: but most metonyms are at least reasonable heuristics to begin with, given an environment (ie statistical distribution of happenings)
[2:38 PM] suspended reason: when you have adversarial players tho, they purposefully decouple the relationship
[2:44 PM] suspended reason: it'd be interesting to think through the relevant superset—instances where signifiers and -ieds drift naturally apart, or else are strategically uncoupled

## Cartographic Compression

> This is where maps (and trails) come in. Maps are compressions of the aboutness-extraction type. They represent and highlight certain features of the domain, forming a useful model, and ignore or downplay others.

> Language itself acts as a store of information, shared among minds, and language tends toward compression. As stories and concepts are shared, they become more compressed, until they reach the final stage: a metonym, a single word that represents a story or concept that conversation partners are expected to understand. A word is the ultimate tl:dr for human communication

## Meaning & Pointing

> Mountains last for millions of years. Buildings last for decades and stay in the same place. But nothing is static in information space. So what are the landmarks here, the unchanging (or predictably changing) features that anchor our mental maps? Since nothing is unchanging in this landscape, I think we must create landmarks, or perhaps the illusion of landmarks. Ultimate values (in the sense of Baumeister’s first need for meaning, above) must be carefully maintained through shared social signaling in order to seem unchanging. Identities are a kind of socially maintained landmark, either the identities of existing, living people, or the identities of deceased ancestors, historical figures, narrative characters, or deities. Baumeister’s illusory “fulfillment states” (imagined future states of perfect happiness) can be unchanging landmarks precisely because they do not exist. If unchanging or predictably changing landmarks are necessary for the navigation of information space, and if they cannot really exist, then “seeing through” this healthy illusion poses a risk for explorers.

> Our information world is changing much faster than that of our ancestors. In navigating this nauseating landscape, we need fixed points that do not exist.

> Pointing, Goodwin says, is not “a simple way of indicating some prelinguistic ‘thing’ in the surround,” but a complex act of communication that utilizes mutual mental modeling and often language.

Pointers rely on convention, context, grounding (the immediate environment). If any of these things changed, the [[indexicality|indexical]] is untethered!

# [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] 1969: "Expression Games" 

_See larger [[Strategic Interaction]] entry._

[[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] talks at length about metonyms—the signals and cues, expressions and communications, that we base our larger, abductive assessments of reality on. We regularly use metonymic cues to get at the greater whole (indeed, as the whole can never be fully apprehended, this is the only way...), but this tendency is exploitable; others can design cues and signals in such a way that gives a very different appearance. For example, a plane flying over enemy territory might use the metonym of "the shape of tanks from above" as the premise for later abductions as to the presence of enemy tanks proper. But, this metonym is not the whole, and is exploitable: now, the enemy set up rubber or wooden tanks which are indistinguishable from the air, causing false inference by air surveillance.

One approach is to avoid singular cues, even those which feel most reliable, and instead asses "the meshing of cues." Because "the world is real," [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] writes (waxing philosophically), and because its "multitude of little events [are understood] in real connection with others," we tend to assume that "when a multitude of independent signs tell the same story, this can be taken for the way things are." (We are close to theories of paranoia and manipulation, here.) That is, when many metonymic implications add up in the same way, that implication is taken as reality. But, [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] notes, this can and has been exploited in strategic interaction: 

> just before a major invasion we can expect a diffusion and intensification of the theater of war—the real peak of the dramatic season. For example, just before D-Day the Allies apparently concerted their double agents to feed the Germans the false line that the invasion was to occur at Calais in June. A German reconnaissance plane was allowed to succeed in getting over Dover harbor where it could photograph landing craft that could not make it to Normandy and therefore must be for Calais. In the Dover area badly camouflaged armored divisions could be seen, but not seen well enough to tell that the equipment was made from inflated rubber. Mock-up airfields and naval vessels were employed, and at the same time, real installations were camouflaged to look like barns and outbuildings. Radio messages, interceptable, emanated from a headquarters in southeast England, giving the strong impression that the invasion would not be in the Normandy area; the messages, however, originated in the real headquarters and were telephoned to the false one. A stand-in for Montgomery was in Gibraltar preparing to go to Africa, which argued that the major invasion was unlikely from England. In Geneva "all available copies of Michelin map No. 51 (the Calais-Arras area) were bought up." And the Calais area was bombed twice as much as the Normandy area.

# Recognition-primed decisions

Gary Klein:

> That became part of our model—the question of how people with experience build up a repertoire of patterns so that they can immediately identify, classify, and categorize situations, and have a rapid impulse about what to do. Not just what to do, but they're framing the situation, and their frame is telling them what are the important cues. That's why they're always looking, or usually looking, in the right place. They know what to ignore, and what they have to watch carefully.  

> So their decision-making, we call it recognition primed decisions. The decisions are primed by their ability to recognize situations, and balanced by the monitoring of the mental simulation.

# Commonplace

From _The Flatland Almanack_, on [[Jacob Clifton]]'s writing for _TV Without Pity_:

> My favorite Jacob recaps are his recaps of The Apprentice, which I still watch in order to appreciate to the fullest Jacob's recaps. For one thing, Jacob has an awe-inspiring grasp of what one of my friends calls "inferential psychology"---i.e., the careful study of the foot of Hercules in order to infer the rest. For another, he clearly understands the principles of group psychology and group dynamics, meaning that his commentary is instructive and discerning and frequently educational. He also has that one thing you have to be born with if you're going to have it at all: the writer's gift for discerning the telling detail, the defining phrase.

From DeLillo's _The Names_:

> We discussed the evolution of letters. The praying-man shape of the Sinai. The ox pictograph. Aleph, alpha. From nature, you see. The ox, the house, the camel, the palm of hand, the water, the fish. From the external world. What men saw, the simplest things. Everyday objects, animals, parts of the body. It's interesting to me, how these marks, these signs that appear so pure and abstract to us, began as objects in the world, living things.
