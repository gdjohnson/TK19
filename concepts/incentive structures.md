# Broken and perverse incentives
Zvi, interview:

> Within a given organization, what I call the maze level, the amount of maze activity relative to other activity, is almost always going up, or at least not going down. It is very difficult to reduce the amount of maze actiivity because people who are in a maze, who want to be rewarded in a maze, realize they will gain by rewarding  behaviors that encourage maze behavior. It's a self-reinforcing implicit conspiracy: you drive out anybody who doesn't support the conspiracy. Once this gets sufficient toe-hold, it is very difficult to reverse. 

> Also, a given organization's original purpose loses meaning and match to the situation over time.

## Examples

From Robert Jackall, _[[_Moral Mazes_]]_:
> When a weaver is unable to repair a stop, she shuts down the loom and flags a “fixer,” the most skilled and highest-ranking worker on the shop floor, who does the repair or basic maintenance necessary to get the loom working again. However, since weavers are paid by the piece and can make no gain from a loom out of service for repair or maintenance during their own shifts, weavers will tend to remedy stops in any way they can in order to keep their cloth production high, leaving the maintenance and repair of the machinery and the economic cost involved to another weaver on another shift. Supervisors and managers who are evaluated by a plant’s overall weaving efficiency are thus forced to monitor the number of loom stops constantly in order to make sure that looms badly in need of repair or maintenance get proper attention. Whenever structural inducements place premiums on immediate personal gains, especially when mistakes are not penalized, there seems to be a sharp decline in the likelihood of men and women sacrificing their own interests for others, for their organizations, or least of all for the common weal.
