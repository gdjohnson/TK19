[[Ian Cheng]]: "Worlding is the art of devising a World [that can perpetuate itself]." [[Peli Grietzer]]: "While there is no real technical criterion that qualifies a category to be a 'domain,' the intuitive criterion used by AI researchers it that it must be possible to think of the domain as a generative system, even if only abstractly or metaphorically." [[Dana Ward]], whose poetry is some of the best I know: "The books that you’re talking about (_Typing Wild Speech_, _The Squeakquel_, _Some Other Deaths of Bas Jan Ader_) were just really generative for me. Each of them had a particular gravity that kept me afloat, so I wrote some other poems I could constellate around them."

[[Simon Reynolds]] has pointed out the trend in electronica toward worldbuilding, from the dusty analogue-futurism of Burial to the amnesiac nostalgia of The Caretaker's _An Empty Bliss Beyond This World_.

[[information theory|information]] changes you. Navigating new worlds and bringing home the knowledge changes you. This is what [[Cab Broskoski]] means when he talks about the used book shop's promise as a catalogue of worlds, portals, "nodal points" that shape you. This is what [[Jacob Clifton]] means when he talks about become more, it's what people in general mean by "growth." Experience, books—they're vectors for the two kinds of information; one of inference the other of empiricism. The book-as-world is all over Borges. The Book of Knowledge, Adam's apple, the psychedelic trip. It's the Campbellian hero's journey, really: you leave your world, and enter a new world, and then come back home with the knowledge and experience of the beyond.
