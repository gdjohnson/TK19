In [[_Blue Velvet_]], when Isabella Rossellini runs around the suburbs naked, it isn't "sexy"—it's horrifying, it's disturbing, you want to wrap a blanket around her. A woman naked like that, at night, in public—something has gone terribly wrong.

When Adam & Eve eat the apple, and gain self-consciousness, they recognize their nudity. Nudity is a symbol for exposure, for all your faults and flaws being visible and inspectable—to have "the social world focused on your self-evident inadequacies" ([[Jordan B. Peterson]]).
