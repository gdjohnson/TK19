# Cappelen & Dever 2019: Bad Language

Cappelen & Dever's project is to nuance an "idealized," academic conception of conversation—that it is a "fundamentally cooperative" activity, where "each participant... contributes to the conversation in an attempt to further" some shared goal—a goal which often involves building up a body of common knowledge, or exchanging information. The pair lean heavily on [[Paul Grice|Grice]]'s Cooperative Principle, constituted of Maxims of Quality & Quantity, Maxim of Relation, and Maxim of Manner:

The Cooperative Principle (quot. [[Paul Grice|Grice]]): "Make your conversational contribution such as is required, at the stage at which it occurs, by the accepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange in which you are engaged." 

1. Maxim of quality: The contribution should be true and informative and not misleading.
2. Maxim of quantity: The contribution should provide an appropriate amount of information, and in a reasonably concise way.
3. Maxim of relation: The contribution should be relevant, should follow the flow of the conversation.
4. Maxim of manner: Be perspicuous, unambiguous, orderly, follow customs.

As [[Paul Grice|Grice]] acknowledges, these expectations of _linguistic_ social interaction are merely expectations of social action broadly: that it is nominally cooperative or friendly, that it is pertinent (the default logic for sense-making). 

But many people, Cappelen & Dever assert, "engage in speech reasons that have nothing to do with trying to accumulate knowledge"—may instead wish to "embarrass or make fun of or encourage or repress."

In other words, the goals of linguistic production and interaction are as wide of the goals of social interaction and action broadly.

## The idealized picture to [[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]]

From _Power & Symbolic Language_:

> Quite apart from the literary (and especially poetic) uses of language, it is rare in everyday life for language to function as a pure instrument of communication. The pursuit of maximum informative efficiency is only exceptionally the exclusive goal of linguistic production and the distinctly instrumental use of language which it implies generally clashes with the often unconscious pursuit of symbolic profit.

# Implicature

# Cappelen & Dever 2019: Bad Language

> Conversational implicature will often involve a trade-off of decreased labor for the speaker (who doesn't have to do the work of selecting and uttering as many words) and increased labor for the audience (who has to do the extra work of calculating the non-explicit communicative intentions of the speaker). Because there is a trade-off in labor, one effect is that conversational implicatures can have is to make power relations within the conversation. The speaker who communicates by implicature can be revealing (or even signaling) that they are the dominant party in the conversation, and in a position to demand that the audience do the interpretative work.  

## Implicature vs. inference

Implicature is designed subtext, a way of saying something without saying it. Inference is the logical reasoning out of entailments. Thus implicature works by the receiver's inference of the text's entailment (here its subtext).

## Insinuation

See Liz Camp 2018 on insinuation—the advancing of an implicature specifically with the purpose of having [[plausibility|plausible]] deniability if facing opposition.

## Switching to a new coordinative equilibrium

One of the problems of tacit coordination is getting stuck in inefficient or Pareto-dominated equilibria. Players who switch off the equilibria in search of a more efficient one will, by definition, lose utility in the short term, even if they recover it in the long term. Synchronous switching to a new equilibrium is thus strategically ideal.

Consider Pinker, Lee, & Nowak's work on innuendo and indirect speech. A speaker, X, hints in a way that is plausibly deniable, or at the very least, that interlocutor Y can choose to ignore (can "do being ordinary"; see [[strategic interaction]]) or affirm, depending on whether he, too, wishes to switch to a new equilibrium.
