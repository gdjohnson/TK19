Sophists were tutors in the 5th century BCE Athens who offered educations to wealthy, aristocratic Greek men. These educations varied, but typically included instruction on rhetoric and virtue (_arete_).

With the writings of Herodotus, and increasing travel and trade, Greece became, in the time of the Sophists, much more cosmopolitan. This opened up a diminishing belief in the "naturalness" of their society, and an increasing suspicion that their customs and laws were fundamentally _conventional_. The division between physis (nature) and nomos (custom) would become a crucial one for the Sophists. Antiphon, for instance, theorized that conventions are designed to limit our natural passions for the social good; Callicles, meanwhile, cast convention and justice as a kind of "slave morality," the revenge and constraint by the many of the few.

# Etymology

"Sophist" is derived from the Greek word for wisdom, and it was Protagoras (at least, according to Plato) who, as a tutor of rhetoric and virtue, first self-consciously called himself a sophist as an advertisement for his position and role. Soon he was followed by many other tutors, until the definition of sophist as tutor, and not merely as a person of wisdom (as it had signified previously), was established. But the real-world troubles of the sophists, as a group, led to a decline in their reputation; the death of [[Socrates]] was, some scholars argue, an over-response to the excesses of the sophists (to whom Socrates was aligned primarily in name, if not in practice; he did not charge fees for his instructions, nor claim to tutor wisdom, but was sentenced for the crime of the category’s “typicals”). By the time of Plato and Aristotle, "sophist" had become somewhat of an insult, and in their wake, it would come to be reshaped into its modern usage, as one who cleverly misleads through fallacy. 

In other words, an abstract descriptor (map) of a qualitative value was voluntarily coupled with a real-world group (territory), and as that group's reputation soured, so too did the connotations and eventually the full meaning of the original descriptor. The word was "anchored" to a quality, and then became anchored instead to a group which claimed to possess that quality, and thus as their reputation changed in Athens, so too did the word's meaning, which indirectly derives from its anchor in the territory (mediated by others' use of it, which is affected by their feelings toward the territory).

# In contrast to philosophy

Plato and Aristotle defined philosophy in juxtaposition with sophistry, and [[Socrates]] became an exemplary hero in this refactoring, claiming only to ask questions, rather than provide answers. Where philosophy's founding form was the questioning dialogue, sophistry's was the persuasive speech. "If one is so inclined," the IEP writes, "sophistry can thus be regarded, in a conceptual as well as historical sense, as the 'other' of philosophy." 

# Legacy

To Hegel, the sophists were a skeptical, "subjective" response to presocratics' "objectivism"; Plato and Aristotle would synthesize, dialectically, both positions. To Derrida and Francois-Lyotard, the sophists are a precursor or extended relation to postmodernism.
