_See also [[strategic interaction]]. [[Selection games]] are a specific subset of strategy games that are relatively unique to institutional modernity._

McKinsey 1952, _Theory of Games_: the strategy game framework throws "light on all kinds of situation in which various people have opposing goals and in which each of them, although he may exert some influence on the outcome, cannot completely dominate the course of events."

Your goal in adversarial strategy games is to push opponents into lose-lose situationsâ€”to disempower them.

# [[Jessie Bernard]] 1954: The Theory of Games of Strategy as a Modern Sociology of Conflict

> For many years economists began their analyses with a single individual and on the basis of this so-called "Robinson Crusoe model" erected a system of theory in which individuals tended to maximize their gains in a world in which they had control over most of the factors involved. Such a model, however, did not fit the facts of life very closely. Actually people are rigorously and even rigidly limited in their behavior. They have to plain their behavior with the knowledge that they may be checkmated at any point by opponents. They do not have a free situation in which they can maximize their benefits. They are in a system in which every choice of behavior on their part may be nullified by some choice of behavior on the part of someone else.

> [In the Robinson Crusoe model], the system can... plan policy under conditions which, in so far as they are controllable at all, it alone controls. In such an isolated system, no game exists; policy problems are not strategic but are engineering. No other system can now force moves or deflect policy. 

> It may even be that the scientist is peculialary unfitted for inventing good strategies in a conflict situation. He is not accustomed to dealing with forces that fight back, try to deceive, or deliberately becloud the situation. The story is told that a medium once invited the distinguished Harvard psychologist, Dr. William McDougall, to investigate her performance in order to demonstrate the validity of her supernatural skills. The magician, Houdini, stepped in and volunteered to do the investigating instead, on the grounds that a scientist could not detect the tricks but that he, a fellow-trickster, could. It may be that the scientific habit of thought which the profession of science selects and cultivates operatoes on a plane where a moral and intellectual and philosophical atmosphere unfits the scientist for the creation of conflict policies.
