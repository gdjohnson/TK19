We do not live in the modern era. We are not disenchanted. Our science and medicine is still primitive. Our beliefs are still magical.

[[Jason Josephson-Storm]], _The Myth of Disenchantment_:

> In particular, while tracing many different characterizations of modernity, I focus especially on the theorists who defined [[modernity]] in terms of the loss of myth, popular belief in spirits, or magic... my point is that “modernity” as it has long been defined — as a world that is “disenchanted” (devoid of belief in spirits, myth, and magic) — does not accurately describe the world we live in.

## Habermas, Modernity: An Incomplete Project:

> The word ‘modern’ in its Latin form ‘modernus’ was used for the first time in the late 5th century in order to distinguish the present, which had become officially Christian, from the Roman and pagan past… People considered themselves modern during the period of Charles the Great in the twelfth century, as well as in France of the late seventeenth century.

## Barzun 1983: A Stroll with [[William James]]

> In that effervescent time [of first years of the 20th C,] the philanthropic passions of western man seemed to have broken all the restraints of habit and prudence. It would take a book to enumerate the independent impulses struggling to make all things new. Primitivism (natural foods, the simplified life, nudism) was rife. It informed the admiration of Javanese art and of the African sculpture that inspired Picasso and Vlaminck. It spurred the youth movements—the "wandering birds," often of both sexes, in the German woods, English lanes, and French inns. It reinforced the passion for [[sports]] and a concern for hygiene. Sexuality benefited from this new cult of regarding the body with simplicity, and eugenics—mating with an eye to physical perfection and sterilizing the unfit—was cool discussed.
