Our adjectives are vague enough that we can see very different people interpreting the same phrase very differently. When a skeptic argues that science is "frequently" wrong, how frequent is frequent? Which kinds of science? How wrong?

What does it mean to say man is “fundamentally” rational or irrational? Could we imagine to individuals, having read all the relevant psychological studies, nonetheless taking differing stances on this high-level abstraction? What does it mean to say that racism is “prevalent” in this country, or America is "fundamentally" white supremacist? How would one begin to resolve this? Can we imagine how much individuals might—and do, actively—vary in their understanding of that word “prevalent,” and that word “racism”? What does it mean, John asks, to say a zebra is fundamentally white, with black stripes, or fundamentally black, with white stripes? Similarly, how can we say whether America is "fundamentally" built on a concept of individual liberty, or "fundamentally" built atop human bondage? And can we imagine two individuals, able to agree on every relevant historical fact, and yet who conceptualize them in aggregate very differently?

encouraging people to introspect and look for negative thought patterns in themselves increases the propensity for those thoughts to manifest

self-identification with labels such as anxious or depressed that depict these feelings as being innate and harmful rather than transient and universal only cause such conditions to worsen. you are what you think you are.

[9:03 AM] snav: yes the issue is not with the introspection qua introspection, but with introspection as act of judgment + attempt to overcome emotion via will
[9:03 AM] snav: most people do it wrong -- the Buddhists had it "more right"
[9:04 AM] snav: introspective judging is something like: "feeling emotion, i don't want it [maybe it's depression]", which always brings it back to this "i" which accepts or rejects the emotion as a part of "you", as opposed to a better stance of "feeling emotion, what could it mean?" which is exploratory and non-judgmental and doesn't involve this act of resistance
[...]
[6:12 AM] suspended reason: This seems right but I've also been thinking about the angle where the past doesn't actually need constant revisiting
[6:12 AM] suspended reason: Let's call these situations "the past is not present until you make it present"
[6:13 AM] suspended reason: No question that "the past is, whether you want it to be or not, fully present" scenarios exist—and maybe I'm overestimating how often the past gets dredged up in a way that's not actually relevant or necessary or productive
[6:14 AM] suspended reason: I was watching GG last night (I know, I know, a terrible model for thinking seriously about these things, but I take what I can get) and Dan & Serena, having gotten back together after a split, are doing juuuuuust fine—making out in the library, getting handsy on the Met steps
[6:15 AM] suspended reason: and then all their "mature" parents tell them that the "adult" thing to do is have a long chat about why they broke up in the first place, and work through those problems together, and process their feelings, and when they do that, they end up breaking up all over again!
[6:15 AM] suspended reason: Maybe we can call "the past isn't present til you make it present" a subset of "if it ain't broke don't fix it"
[6:17 AM] suspended reason: Now I'll happily cede that if D&S fall to tatters upon trying to have a conversation about their feelings and history, they're probably doomed in the first place. But I guess it's not clear to me that history always needs dredging up to be re-litigated in the present, even if sometimes, it definitely should be.
[6:21 AM] suspended reason: It's good Crispy brought up self-care, because I think when you start putting the pieces together on these cultural elements—the identitarianism, [[trauma]], the therapyspeak, the self-care—you start coming up on what to me feels like a big underlying problem, which is navel-gazing
[6:23 AM] suspended reason: It's not that any of these elements are bad on their own, or bad for everyone—again, like, I've been convinced by Snav and Karen Horney and Kaj's UtEB review that [[trauma]] is a real thing worth working through—but when they become ubiquitous ideology, and a huge % of population adopts them, it starts looking a lot like a culture of narcissism.
[6:23 AM] suspended reason: This is probably the first time I've been able to coherently put this argument down, so open to pushback
[6:50 AM] snav: The past is always present---in the form of priors
[6:52 AM] snav: and self-historical narrativizing is only one way of dealing (cf. Buddhist or stoic practice, etc)
[6:52 AM] suspended reason: that's just not true
[6:52 AM] suspended reason: not all of the past is actively present in a meaningful way
[6:53 AM] suspended reason: some residue of the past being technically in the priors doesn't functionally equate to it being meaningfully present IMO
[6:53 AM] snav: i think that residue "is" the past for an individual, practically speaking
[6:54 AM] suspended reason: okay but loop in my #link-dump messages
[6:54 AM] suspended reason: how is this diff from evpsych
[6:54 AM] suspended reason: speculation about conservation of history
[6:54 AM] snav: oh evpsych just claims to be a Serious Science is all
[6:54 AM] snav: that's the only real difference, i mean, the systems work if you believe in them
[6:55 AM] snav: but they work differently based on the degrees of freedom within the system and the basic assumptions
[6:56 AM] snav: but i feel like you're doing a signal corrective here and im not
[6:56 AM] snav: so i should probably duck out, because i support the signal corrective, which is to say the stupid version of trauma theory is culturally harmful
[6:56 AM] snav: my only fear is throwing the baby out with the bathwater
[6:56 AM] suspended reason: wait wait wait
[6:56 AM] suspended reason: I agree
[6:57 AM] suspended reason: but aren't you doing an SC with evpsych?
[6:57 AM] snav: yes
[6:57 AM] suspended reason: or rather the link dump abstract is
[6:57 AM] suspended reason: okay
[6:57 AM] suspended reason: then i  guess we all agree :smile:
[6:57 AM] snav: what's interesting to me is how it's almost like the narcissistic stance pre-empts and then co-opts each new theory for "it's" own gain
[6:58 AM] suspended reason: that I also believe
[6:58 AM] snav: ultimately the problem isn't really about the past but is "it's always about me"

[9:19 AM] Natural Hazard: Some meta thoughts on [[signalAndCorrectives|signal corrective]] Dynamics. The way that I wanted to navigate around that originally was by just looking at very specific instantiations and investigating what we think of them (in the pfeilstorch thread I picked an Ashcroft thing to go at).  That helps move the convo away from generalizations and emphasis, but it seems to be not enough.
[9:20 AM] Natural Hazard: Because it seems like what we've learned to expect is that someone trying to get assent on specifics is often a precursor to liscence generalizations.
[9:21 AM] Natural Hazard: You can do a "not all / at least one" prisoner exchange, where you find a definitive positive example of the thing, and I found a negative example. That feels like the MINIMUM required for progress. Like, if you can do that your dialog is fucked. But it's also still wanting in many ways.
[9:26 AM] Natural Hazard: I bet at some point @snav, @suspended reason , and I have all readily admitted "not all / at least one", but that's probs what motivates us to keep on this topic. There's a bunch of v specific cases where I'm v set on the introspective frame, and for many of those I'm still uncertain if we'd agree on them or not. I bet the same goes for everyone else. I bet @suspended reason still has some concrete thing ls there he's like "a trauma adjacent frame is defs harming here and I don't actually know if @snav  or @Natural Hazard would agree"
[10:02 AM] suspended reason: Yeah
[10:02 AM] suspended reason: NA/ALO is a good compression
[10:03 AM] suspended reason: I think on a ton of topics NA/ALO is the ready concession of both sides, which is why I think I've conceptualized it as a "rounding" problem in the past
[10:04 AM] suspended reason: When the data set under discussion is itself vague, there's no way around all participants being hazy on where exactly, on the spectrum between NA and ALO, the judgment falls, and people end up framing it like overrated/underrated [[torque epistemology|signal-corrective]] style, but they end up talking past each other because they have different understandings of the signal

# Types of rounding

1. Rounding on a population: what % of X is Y vs Z?
2. Rounding on causal weight: Both Y and Z contribute to X, but which contributes more?
3. Rounding on consequences: X can lead to Y and Z, but which more often? (This might just be a population rounding, my carvings are pretty incoherent right now but they can give us a start)
4. Rounding based on pragmatic addressability: if Y is more addressable than Z, we emphasize Y. (e.g. nature vs nurture, for now)
5. Rounding based on comparative attention (niche saturation): if Y is always/usually addressed/attributed/assumed as cause/character of X, push Z
6. Rounding based on effects of rounding/narrative: if attributing to Y causes harm, or "is giving ammo to the enemy," push narrative Z instead
7. Top-down justificational rounding (cf [[pragmatic ontology|decision rules]]): if you go into the question "What causes X?" with a desired end (e.g. prison abolition), then you manufacture or emphasize cause Y over Z because it's necessary to justify the desired end
8. Coalition-based rounding
9. Implicit blame-game rounding (If Y and Z and both causes of X, and Y is blaming "the wrong person," emphasize only Z's causal role)

Until there is a reliable method for parties to agree on criteria by which to define a sample set, and further, for randomly sampling that dataset, and even further for making neutral assessments as to which narrative abstraction the individual case supports, such generalizations are impossible to rigorously or perhaps even _meaningfully_ compare in their explanatory power.

Instead, discourse particularly in the humanities is largely a matter of emphasis, that X is causally underrated or Y causally overrated (rather than innovations of new X's and Y's).
