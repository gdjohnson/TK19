Deontological v consequentialist approaches, when it comes to non-moral domains, is actually a surprisingly good indicator of whether someone's LARPing/in it for identitarian reasons or not. Deontological = you plug into existing, legible, recognized patterns for X archetype you want to be seen as/want to see yourself as. They don't "fit" very well in the present moment tho cuz they're not adapted/native to it—they're historical costuming that you get all sweaty in, you drag the dress hem down the streets of Manhattan, etc. Consequentialist = what you do when your'e actually trying to perform at high levels in a given domain, which is often illegible b/c the patterns of doing X at a high-level in the present-day aren't established/widely recognized yet. Tempted to say the same sorta applies to morals—that the draw of deontology (X just is bad and I won't do it, or Y just is good so I'll do it) is that it's anxiolytic for the practitioner—but that's a separate take. ^912523
