When I'm in an impatient mood I'm just thinking "It's literally just an alley, mate. It's not a 'hidden portal'. There aren't 'codes and signs' everywhere. You live in a boring city in a boring world like everyone else. Grow up." (Ian Sinclair, Dissensus)

“To analyze while still leaving the magic and the mystery. To elucidate and complicate, to explain and mystify at the same time.” (Paglia 1992)

[[Jason Josephson-Storm]], _The Myth of Disenchantment_:

> In particular, while tracing many different characterizations of modernity, I focus especially on the theorists who defined [[modernity]] in terms of the loss of myth, popular belief in spirits, or magic... my point is that “modernity” as it has long been defined — as a world that is “disenchanted” (devoid of belief in spirits, myth, and magic) — does not accurately describe the world we live in.
