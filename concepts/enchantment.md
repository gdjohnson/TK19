When I'm in an impatient mood I'm just thinking "It's literally just an alley, mate. It's not a 'hidden portal'. There aren't 'codes and signs' everywhere. You live in a boring city in a boring world like everyone else. Grow up." (Ian Sinclair, Dissensus)

“To analyze while still leaving the magic and the mystery. To elucidate and complicate, to explain and mystify at the same time.” (Paglia 1992)
