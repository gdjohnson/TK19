# The lifespan of concepts

See [[telephone effect]] and [[Reification]].

Bruce Lee:

> It is conceivable that a long time ago a certain martial artist discovered some partial truth. During his lifetime, the man resisted the temptation to organize this partial truth, although this is a common tendency in a man’s search for security and certainty in life. After his death, his students took “his” hypothesis, “his” postulates and “his” method and turned them into law. Impressive creeds were then invented, solemn reinforcing ceremonies prescribed, rigid philosophy and patterns formulated, and so on, until finally an institution was erected. So what originated as one man’s intuition of some sort of personal fluidity was transformed into solidified, fixed knowledge, complete with organized classified responses presented in a logical order. In so doing, the well-meaning, loyal followers not only made this knowledge a holy shrine but also a tomb in which they buried the founder’s wisdom.

[[Sarah Perry]] sees there being a "scientific" and "folk" version of many concepts, from Vitamin C to ego/id/superego to Dunning-Kreuger. But I think this separation misleads: in reality, there are varying levels of technically precise use, and many scientists themselves routinely stretch or amputated (in a Procrustean sense) the finding of a study, or the meaning of a concept, in order to make them more directly applicable to the researcher's own agenda and research interest. 

In popular domains, with something like continental philosophy there's a mechanism where abstract, ambiguous language gets disambiguated through relation to your own experience, that's how you make sense of it—you find a referent to match its reference. So if you've had similarish thoughts or feelings, that Derrida line is gonna scan as describing that thought/feeling, but it might not even be about that.

Longform may help disambiguate through coordination of its many parts—at least if the reader is committed to coherence. If the rule of Chinese whisper's is "Ideas don't convert people so much as people convert ideas," longform allows the long, slow, steady conversion of its reader's schema:

> In explanation, let us mobilize Shaw and turn a turn of phrase. If, _The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man._, so too can we understand art. Only literature which imposes itself on the reader can effect transformation either personal or cultural, and thus those who look to the arts for more than leisure and pastime must seek out only unreasonable works. It is readily apparent why this would be true in matters of content and subject: works which are perfectly agreeable ethically and philosophically, which do not confront and therefore require the reconciliation of the reader, cannot transform — can only reaffirm consensus. 

Aphorism, on the other hand, is fertile ground for projection: there aren't enough signifiers to coordinate a determinate meaning between.

## Adaptation vs drift

In linguistics, *drift* is linguistic evolution that occurs via segregation of speakers, with local populations converging on dialects, mutually influencing each other at higher rates than they influence or are influenced by outsiders. *Adaptation*, meanwhile, captures linguistic evolution that results from changing environmental circumstances, which is to say, from new purposes, functions, and ambient objects which need identification, distinguishing, manipulation, and reference.

## Genericizing

![[_Speculations_#^730690]]

## From folk to scientific concepta

*Widen & Russell 2010: Descriptive and Prescriptive Definitions of Emotion*

> Science often begins with everyday concepts and assumptions (plane geometry was based on the assumption that the earth is flat). As science progresses, however, the original concepts and assumptions can change or even disappear. For example, when ancient people exerted force, they felt muscular strain as they pushed or pulled. This feeling of strain was central to the concept of force in ancient physics. Jammer (1957) described the slow and jagged path that the concept of force traveled from its origin in everyday thought through a series of scientific proposals and then to its role in modern physics. Over that history, the word force covered a variety of phenomena, and some theorists called for abandoning the concept. In modern science, force remains, but is understood in a way qualitatively different from its origin. A different fate is seen in the concept of constellation. When ancient people in different parts of the world looked at the night sky, they saw constellations of stars. Early astronomers studied constellations, and the concept of a constellation remained central to astronomy for centuries. But, constellation is not a scientific concept in modern astronomy.

## Handle as anchor: the effect of a name

When concepts spread, they spread as handles, and they are often ported across contexts without a clear definition. Often, meaning must be inferred from the name itself, e.g. with reference to the etymologies of its constituent parts. As a result, as terms make subcultural leaps, they often are "doubled" into a second concept linked to the first _only through the name_. For instance, the death drive in [[people/Sigmund Freud|Freud]] has been misconstrued in the public discourse as high risk-taking behavior, intuitively a "drive toward death" (which is, itself, a real phenomenon in the "excess of signification" that perhaps always _wanted_ a handle, and at last had found one).

Similarly, Simon Reynolds writes of acid house:

> When British youth first encountered the term Acid House they misconstrued it. In Chicago, acid came from "acid burn," slang for ripping off someone's idea (by sampling it). But in Britain, it was assumed that "acid" meant psychedelics. So acid house became the soundtrack to the Ecstasy rave-olution.

## Semantic changes

## Semantic chaining

Xu, Regier, Malt 2015: Historical Semantic Chaining and Efficient Communication: 

> A name for one referent is extended to a conceptually related referent, and from there on to other referents, producing a chain of exemplars that all bear the same name. The beginning and end points of such a chain might in principle be rather dissimilar

# [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]: Truth & Lies in a Nonmoral Sense

The nominal fallacy:

> When someone hides something behind a bush and looks for it again in the same place and finds it there as well, there is not much to praise in such seeking and finding. Yet this is how matters stand regarding seeking and finding "truth" within the realm of reason. If I make up the definition of a mammal, and then, after inspecting a camel, declare "look, a mammal' I have indeed brought a truth to light in this way, but it is a truth of limited value. 

Against Platonic forms:

> Every concept arises from the equation of unequal things. Just as it is certain that one leaf is never totally the same as another, so it is certain that the concept "leaf" is formed by arbitrarily discarding these individual differences and by forgetting the distinguishing aspects. This awakens the idea that, in addition to the leaves, there exists in nature the "leaf": the original model according to which all the leaves were perhaps woven, sketched, measured, colored, curled, and painted--but by incompetent hands, so that no specimen has turned out to be a correct, trustworthy, and faithful likeness of the original model.

On extensions and the impossibility of eidetic reduction:

> We call a person "honest," and then we ask "why has he behaved so honestly today?" Our usual answer is, "on account of his honesty." Honesty! This in turn means that the leaf is the cause of the leaves. We know nothing whatsoever about an essential quality called "honesty"; but we do know of countless individualized and consequently unequal actions which we equate by omitting the aspects in which they are unequal and which we now designate as "honest" actions. Finally we formulate from them a qualities occulta which has the name "honesty." We obtain the concept, as we do the form, by overlooking what is individual and actual; whereas nature is acquainted with no forms and no concepts, and likewise with no species, but only with an X which remains inaccessible and undefinable for us.

# James 1890: Principles of Psychology

## Concepts as regularities

TK TK TK

## The reification of concepts

The names we give to these concepts, to these collections of properties, to these regularities in the world are easily reified:

> Locke undermined the fallacy. But none of his successors, so far as I know, have radically escaped it, or seen that the only meaning of essence is teleological, and that classification and conception are purely teleological weapons of the mind. _The essence of a thing is that one of its properties which is so important for my interests that in comparison with it I may neglect the rest._ Amongst those other things which have this important property I class it, after this property I name it, as a thing endowed with this property I conceive it; and whilst so classing, naming, and conceiving it, all other truth about it becomes to me as naught. The properties which are important vary from man to man and from hour to hour.

> Our usual purpose with [a thing], our commonest title for it, and the properties which this title suggests, have in reality nothing sacramental. They characterize us more than they characterize the thing. But we are so stuck in our prejudices, so petrified intellectually, that to our vulgarest names, with their suggestions, we ascribe an eternal and exclusive worth. [...] we end by believing that to conceive them in those ways is to conceive them in the only true way. Those are no truer ways of conceiving them than any others; they are only more important ways, more frequently serviceable ways. 

I can't help but be reminded of Jacob Falkovich's anecdote about espresso beans and [[social reality]]:

> You know chocolate covered coffee beans? You don't really need the chocolate. If I don't have time and I want a measured dose of caffeine I often just chew on a handful of roasted beans. Now I just told this to my co-worker, who kept insisting that I shouldn't do it because "it's weird" and "not the way it's consumed". When I objected that these two statements are facts about *other humans*, not facts about *coffee beans*, she failed to grasp the distinction. It's always jarring to remember that many (most?) people don't see a difference between social reality and physical reality, and their behavior, even in private, is constrained much more by the former than the latter. Gods and ghosts are more plausible than eating coffee beans.

# Deleuze Seminar on Leibniz, 1980

To Deleuze, philosophers are tasked not with discovering but creating concepts:

>  For me, a philosopher is someone who creates concepts. This implies many things: that the concept is something to be created, that the concept is the product [terme] of a creation.

This view is inherited from Leibniz:

> As background to all this, there was a corresponding problem for Leibniz, but obviously much more general, to wit: what precisely does it mean to do philosophy. Starting from a very simple notion: to do philosophy is to create concepts, just as doing painting is to create lines and colors. Doing philosophy is creating concepts because concepts are not something that pre-exists, not something that is given ready made. In this sense, we must define philosophy through an activity of creation: creation of concepts. This definition seemed perfectly suitable for Leibniz who, precisely, in an apparently fundamentally rationalist philosophy, is engaged in a kind of exuberant creation of unusual concepts of which there are few such strange examples in the history of philosophy.

# Analysis, engineering, etc

## Bishop 1992: The Possibility of Conceptual Clarity in Philosophy

### Overview

Briefly: counterexample philosophy is a naturalistic account of a mode of historical and contemporary philosophizing. It relies on [[conceptual analysis]] and explication, which themselves assume a classical account of concepts which is contradicted by our best scientific understanding of cognition. Philosophers ought to move toward a more "naturalistic" account of their work: the acknowledgment that they are attempting to construct theories, and that conceptual "revisions" of terms succeed on the basis of most effectively support these theories.

### Excerpts

#### Counterexample Philosophy

> Counterexample philosophy is a distinctive pattern of argumentation philosophers since Plato have employed when attempting to hone their conceptual tools. It begins when someone proposes a classical account of a philosophically important concept. A classical account of a concept offers singly necessary and jointly sufficient conditions for the application of a term expressing that concept.

> The list of philosophers who have advanced classical accounts of concepts would not only include many of the greatest figures in the history of philosophy, but also many highly regarded contemporary philosophers. Consider just a fraction of these: David Lewis on convention (1969) and on causation (1973), Alvin Goldman on knowledge (1967), H.P. Grice on meaning (1957), Carl Hempel on explanation (1948), Wesley Salmon on causation (1984), and Hilary Putnam on mental states (1967).

There are three "potential aims" of counterexample philosophy. The first is **[[conceptual analysis]]**: examinations of intension, with reference to other concepts e.g. bachelor & its relation to the concept of marriage. The second is **conceptual explication**, ****an attempt to synchronize the classical account's extension with the **target term**'s extension. These two approaches "set out to preserve something important about the target term"—its intension and extension, respectively—and Bishop believes they can never succeed, are somehow incoherent or impossible. **Conceptual revision**, meanwhile, is a third deployable aim of counterexample philosophy which Bishop deems possible but which struggles with conceptions of what makes one revision "more successful" or less successful without a measure such as accuracy w/r/t target term. "Assuming the conservative endeavors (analysis and explication) are unlikely to succeed, it is essential we respond to this challenge on pain of forfeiting counterexample philosophy as a tool for conceptual clarification."

#### Metaphysical Accounts

> One might argue that these options do not exhaust the potential goals of counterexample philosophy. Philosophers might set themselves the goal of providing an account of metaphysical reality. So (K) succeeds just in case it tells us what knowledge really is. Will the proponent of metaphysical counterexample philosophy offer an account of how we can know when we have found metaphysical reality? If not, then counterexample philosophy is futile since we cannot know when it succeeds... for the purposes of this paper, metaphysical counterexample philosophy can be seen as either futile, an instance of explication, or an instance of revision.

#### Empirical Understandings of Concepts

> Questions about the actual structure of our concepts are in principle as empirical as questions about the actual structure of iron. No one would seriously propose studying the structure of iron by engaging in counterexample philosophy.

> Philosophically pivotal concepts, like most of our concepts, are "attuned to our practical dealings in a complex world where some degree of oversimplification is always necessary in the interests of manageability" ([Rescher] 1985, p. 56)... Even if a concept is structured classically, its domain of effectiveness is limited to normal cases, and so applying its criteria to certain types of cleverly constructed cases will result in the sorts of paradoxes and counterexamples that pervade the philosophical literature.

#### Conceptual Revision

On possible guiding principles for conceptual revision (aka conceptual instrumentalism):

> One plausible variety of conceptual revision involves the principle of theoretical excellence: Adopt the successor concept that is part of the best available empirical theory. The 'best available empirical theory' is the one that possesses the greatest combination of theoretical virtues (such as explanatory and predictive power, accuracy, simplicity, scope)... if the extension of a successor concept is reasonably similar to that of the target concept, and the successor plays a role in a theory that provides more pragmatic and epistemic benefits than any alternative, then it is reasonable to adopt it as a revision of the target concept.

# Against an instrumental theory of concept formation

> Berlin [1992] maintains that [the widespread regularities in the classification and naming of plants and animals among peoples of traditional, nonliterate societies] can best be explained by the similarity of human beings’ largely unconscious appreciation of the natural affinities among groupings of plants and animals: people recognize and name a grouping of organisms quite independently of its actual or potential usefulness or symbolic significance in human society. Berlin’s claims challenge those anthropologists who see reality as a “set of culturally constructed, often unique and idiosyncratic images, little constrained by the parameters of an outside world.”

# LessWrong

## General Semantics

Eric S Raymond 2014: Me & [[LessWrong]]:
> One major difference is that I learned techniques corresponding to much of the the Less Wrong analytical method from Alfred Korzybski’s discipline of General Semantics, a very long time ago. So, for example, when Eliezer writes of bleggs and rubes … this is old news to any student of GS: humans do abstraction for functional reasons, and all categorization is motivated. Next?

## The Cluster Structure in Thingspace

Compare to prototype theory.

> "Radial categories" are how cognitive psychologists describe the non-Aristotelian boundaries of words. The central "mother" conceives her child, gives birth to it, and supports it. Is an egg donor who never sees her child a mother? She is the "genetic mother". What about a woman who is implanted with a foreign embryo and bears it to term? She is a "[[surrogation|surrogate]] mother". And the woman who raises a child that isn't hers genetically? Why, she's an "adoptive mother". The Aristotelian syllogism would run, "Humans have ten fingers, Fred has nine fingers, therefore Fred is not a human" but the way we actually think is "Humans have ten fingers, Fred is a human, therefore Fred is a 'nine-fingered human'."

> We can think about the radial-ness of categories in intensional terms, as described above—properties that are usually present, but optionally absent. If we thought about the intension of the word "mother", it might be like a distributed glow in thingspace, a glow whose intensity matches the degree to which that volume of thingspace matches the category "mother". The glow is concentrated in the center of genetics and birth and child-raising; the volume of egg donors would also glow, but less brightly.

> Or we can think about the radial-ness of categories extensionally. Suppose we mapped all the birds in the world into thingspace, using a distance metric that corresponds as well as possible to perceived similarity in humans: A robin is more similar to another robin, than either is similar to a pigeon, but robins and pigeons are all more similar to each other than either is to a penguin, etcetera.

> ...as I see it, the structure of the cognitive intension followed from the extensional cluster structure. First came the structure-in-the-world, the empirical distribution of birds over thingspace; then, by observing it, we formed a category whose intensional glow roughly overlays this structure. This gives us yet another view of why words are not Aristotelian classes: the empirical clustered structure of the real universe is not so crystalline. A natural cluster, a group of things highly similar to each other, may have no set of necessary and sufficient properties—no set of characteristics that all group members have, and no non-members have.

# Prototype Theory

Heavily inspired by Wittgenstein's writings, and formalized by Eleanor Rosch. Concepts structured around a central prototype, which is a composite or averaging of many experienced exemplars, with a radial space of decreasing prototypicality. Echoed by [[Eliezer Yudkowsky|Yudkowsky]] as the cluster structure of thingspace.

Prototype theory is statistical. Qualities are often not necessary & sufficient; rather, they have some strong graded bearing on categorization, and are summed/averaged otherwise processed into a decision. 

Prototypes are built through examples and extrapolation from them. Repeated exposure to examples leads to an "averaged" representation. Different properties will have different weights. 

## Support for Prototype Theory

Mills 2002, cited in Muehlhauser 2011: "Concepts Don't Work That Way": 

> McCloskey and Glucksberg (1978)... found that when people were asked to make repeated category judgments such as ‘‘Is an olive a fruit?’’ or ‘‘Is a dog an animal?’’ there was a subset of items that individual subjects changed their minds about. That is, if you said that an olive was a fruit on one day, two weeks later you might give the opposite answer. Naturally, subjects did not do this for cases like ‘‘Is a dog an animal?’’ or ‘‘Is a rose an animal?’’ But they did change their minds on borderline cases, such as olive-fruit, and curtains-furniture. In fact, for items that were intermediate between clear members and clear nonmembers, McCloskey and Glucksberg’s subjects changed their mind 22% of the time. This may be compared to inconsistent decisions of under 3% for the best examples and clear nonmembers... Thus, the changes in subjects’ decisions do not reflect an overall inconsistency or lack of attention, but a bona fide uncertainty about the borderline members. In short, many concepts are not clear-cut. There are some items that... seem to be “kind of” members.

## Criticisms of Prototype Theory

1. It works best to describe our System 1 judgments, and does more poorly describing our System 2 or formal categories.
2. It has been criticized for having composition problems, e.g. there is not a prototype structure to "Chairs bought on Wednesday." This example strikes me as very poor; since chairs are prototypal, the compound concept has a prototypal structure even if "bought on Wednesday" does not. If we replace "chairs" with a formal concept like H2O, we are merely reiterating criticism #1. 
3. Some figurations proposed that prototypal features could be easily discerned; the theory became "affiliated with a certain empiricist bent" at a time of "anti-empiricist backlash" in contemporary CogSci ([Weiskopf, IEP](https://www.iep.utm.edu/th-th-co/))

# The Charge from Psychology

The *Charge from Psychology* is the criticism that [[conceptual analysis]], and the classical accounts of concepts on which it rests, does not square with our best scientific understandings of concepts. Rosch's prototype theory is perhaps the primary instigator in cognitive science for such objections. This charge is led by Ramsey 1992: "Prototypes & [[conceptual analysis]]" and echoed in Bishop. It has been rebutted in Sandin 2006: "Has Psychology Debunked [[conceptual analysis]]?"

Lakoff 1987: "Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things" has advanced arguments for generative and radial categories, both of which differ from the classical account of necessary and sufficient conditions. His work with Mark Johnson on embodiment and cognitive metaphor has gestured in a similar direction, though the objection that concepts are *metaphorical* differs somewhat from the claim that concepts are inherently fuzzy, or lack sufficient and necessary criteria. 

Ramsey writes, "the assumption that our intuitive judgments about categorization and class membership can yield a definition for abstract concepts that (1) takes the form of a small conjunctive set of essential properties and (2) coheres with all relevant intuitions and allows no counterexamples." Neither of these assumptions agree with the psychological or cognitive-scientific literature, Ramsey writes.

Today, those philosophers opposed to [[conceptual analysis]] often identify their approach as "naturalistic." This position is aligned with integrative ideologies of scientific philosophies such as practiced at CMU.

# Lakoff & Johnson 1999: Philosophy in the Flesh

On embodied concepts:

> We cannot, as some meditative traditions suggest, "get beyond" our categories and have a purely uncategorized experience. Neural beings cannot do that. What we call concepts are neural structures that allow us to mentally characterize our categories and reason about them. Human categories are typically conceptualized in more than one way, in terms of what are called prototypes. Each prototype is a neural structure that permits us to do some sort of inferential or imaginative task relative to a category. [[genre|Typical-case prototypes]] are used in drawing [[inference|inferences]] about category members in the absence of any special contextual information. Ideal-case prototypes allow us to evaluate category members relative to some conceptual standard. (To see the difference, compare the prototypes for the ideal husband and the typical husband.) Social stereotypes are used to make snap judgments, usually about people. Salient exemplars (well-known examples) are used for making probability judgments. (For a survey of kinds of conceptual prototypes, see A4, Lakoff 1987.) In short, prototype-based reasoning constitutes a large proportion of the actual reason-ing that we do. Reasoning with prototypes is, indeed, so common that it is inconceivable that we could function for long without it.

> When we conceptualize categories in this way, we often envision them using a spatial metaphor, as if they were containers, with an interior, an exterior, and a boundary. When we conceptualize categories as containers, we also impose complex hierarchical systems on them, with some category-containers inside other category-containers. Conceptualizing categories as containers hides a great deal of category structure. It hides conceptual prototypes, the graded structures of categories, and the fuzziness of category boundaries.

> In short, we form extraordinarily rich conceptual structures for our categories and reason about them in many ways that are crucial for our everyday functioning. All of these conceptual structures are, of course, neural structures in our brains. This makes them embodied in the trivial sense that any mental construct is realized neurally. But there is a deeper and more important sense which our concepts are embodied. What makes concepts concepts is their inferential capacity, their ability to be bound together in ways that yield [[inference|inferences]]. An embodied concept is a neural structure that is actually part of, or makes use of, the sensorimotor system of our brains. Much of conceptual inference is, therefore, sensorimotor inference.

# Ramsey 1992: Concepts and Prototype Analysis

Argues from prototype theory (i.e., in the tradition of Wittgenstein) that classical accounts of concepts are impossible and misguided:

Ramsey writes, "the assumption that our intuitive judgments about categorization and class membership can yield a definition for abstract concepts that (1) takes the form of a small conjunctive set of essential properties and (2) coheres with all relevant intuitions and allows no counterexamples."

> If being an intuitive instance of X is simply a matter of having a cluster of properties that is sufficiently similar to some prototype representation, and if there are a number of different ways this can be done, some of which may vary over different contexts, then any crisp definition comprised of some subset of these properties and treating them as necessary and sufficient is never going to pass the test of intuition. It will always admit of intuitive counterexamples because the range of diversity sanctioned by our conceptual representation scheme will be much greater than that allowed by any tidy, straightforward definition. Hence, **the search for a simple, non-disjunctive definition of a given philosophical concept that accords with all of our intuitions and admits of no counterexamples is a hopeless enterprise—there simply is no such thing.**

> Before wrapping up, it's worth reflecting for a moment on just how unsurprising much of this should be to philosophers. The failure of analytic philosophy to produce an uncontroversial, completely satisfactory analysis of the vast majority of abstract concepts should by itself suggest that something is amiss. Moreover, even within the philosophical literature there have been cases suggesting difficulties with intuitions of the sort predicted by the prototype view. Consider Bernard Williams' (1970) well-known discussion of personal identity. Here, a proposed set of conditions for personal identity yields positive intuitive judgments when described in one way, but, as Williams points out, basically the same set of conditions tend to elicit contrary judgments when described somewhat differently. This is, of course, just what one would expect if the categorization judgments are **context-sensitive** in the way suggested by prototype theory.

> As I've tried to show, if the prototype stories are correct, then the two primary expectations philosophers typically place on analyses of concepts—simplicity and avoiding all counter-examples—cannot both be satisfied. Hence, at the very least it looks like one of these criteria will need to be abandoned, or at least significantly relaxed.

> ...abandoning simplicity in order to accommodate all intuitions may be a misguided strategy, and a more promising approach might be the one of preserving simplicity and recognizing that we can't capture all intuitive judgments. Its worth noting that this latter tactic is not entirely foreign to philosophy. For instance, in certain respects it is quite similar to [[Rudolf Carnap|Carnap]]'s (1950) eloquent discussion of concept explication, where revision of our intuitive categorization judgments is explicitly endorsed for the sake of simplicity.

# Graham & Horgan 1994: Southern Fundamentalism & the End of Philosophy

> One hallmark of Twentieth Century Anglo-American philosophy has been the analysis and clarification of philosophically important ideas or concepts -concepts like knowledge, freedom, and belief.

ideology/ideological inquiry, provisionally, = "inquiry into the nature and workings of human ideas or concepts, and into the semantics of the terms that express these concepts; and also ... the facts that such inquiry seeks to discover"

> For a long time during especially the 1950s and 1960s, "Apriori [[conceptual analysis]]" was the popular manner, within philosophy, in which to think of ideology. Apriori [[conceptual analysis]] was the metaphilosophy of ideological inquiry. Apriori conceptual analysts fell into one of two camps: first, the "high church analysts", who basically endorsed a model of analysis as designed to capture precise, informative, tractably specifiable, non-circular necessary and sufficient conditions for the application of philosophically important concepts (conditions definitive of what is sometimes called the Classical View of concepts); and second, the "reformers" who believed that the specification of precise and informative necessary and sufficient conditions is, at most, only feasible for some concepts (perhaps certain concepts in mathematics or physical science), and who try to include reforms or revisionary proposals for definitions of key concepts.

> In the past two decades philosophers have raised doubts about "aprioristic" ways of knowing, as not fitting well with the sort of general overall account of the workings of human cognition that is emerging in developing science, including cognitive science and neuroscience. There is also mounting evidence that human concepts, including ones of interest to philosophers, typically lack precise boundaries and non-circular necessary and sufficient conditions (cf. Rosch 1973, 1975, 1978; Rips 1975; Smith and Medin 1981; Bishop 1992)

> We also think that most attempts to formulate a model of ideology as a broadly aposteriori or empirical interdisciplinary enterprise either make ideology seem totally indistinguishable from field linguistics and cognitive anthropology, thus denuding it of philosophy, or make it so weak and tepid that it is difficult to conceive how it could ever have the sort of central role in philosophy that it has had in this century.

The pair "Post-analytic metaphilosophy" as a new genus of inquiry, to replace "ideological inquiry," and "Southern fundamentalism" as one of its species, for which they will advocate. Post-analytic metaphilosophy challenges:

> ...traditional philosophical assumptions about ideology—for instance, (i) that philosophically interesting concepts usually can be given precise, non-circular, informative, "analyses" or "explications"; (ii) that statements expressing these analyses are analytic truths; and (iii) that we can produce these analyses via a priori reflection.
