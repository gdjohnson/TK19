# [[John Nerst]] 2021: Abolish Secret Ballots

> About a month ago I wrote my last post as an April’s Fools Joke. It was, supposedly, an opinion piece arguing against secret ballots. It’s core argument was that secret ballots enable people to exercise power without accountability, and this is unaccaceptable. My intent was to criticize such accountability-based arguments for restricting free speech and anonymity by applying them to an area where there’s a generally acknowledged near-sacred right both to exercise a modicum of power and to do so anonymously, without having to face social censure or consequences. We recognize that there are strong reasons for voting to be in secret, and I think most of these reasons apply to speech as well.

> Yes, as any parent of teenagers knows, we make better decisions when watched by our peers. We listen to our better angels, make the right decisions, and apprehend the truth the best when under the scrutiny of others. How could this be any more obvious? If it wasn’t true there’d certainly be a lot of waste in society on things that are just for show.

Thinkers' ability to demonstrate the poor predictive power of dominant ideas, or suggest views with higher predictive power, is precisely what makes the entire epistemological process work—even in math, with its so-called "pure" formal abstractions, as argued by Lakatos in Proofs and Refutations.
