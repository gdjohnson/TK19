*Hynes 1997: The Soldiers' Tale*

> Why is not a soldier’s question: Tennyson at least got that part of the Charge of the Light Brigade right: “Theirs not to reason why.” Yet the soldier assumes—must assume—that if he did ask that question, if he were allowed to ask it, there would be a rational answer, that what he is doing and suffering makes sense to someone farther up the chain of command. On occasions when it becomes clear that the answer isn’t rational, or doesn’t exist, the soldier’s response is anger and bitterness

*Upton Sinclair*

> It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.
