From TVTropes:
> Flavor text is any text in a game that is completely unrelated to actual rules or gameplay, and is included merely for effect. Common in almost all Collectible Card Games, as well as Role-Playing Game rulebooks; but it is not limited to Tabletop Games, and also occurs in Video Games.

In other words, there are mechanically relevant and mechanically irrelevant facts; the latter we could just call "aesthetics."

This connects to the idea of "[[pragmatism]]" (like the term "meaningfulness") as an attempt to isolate/emphasize what mattersâ€”in other words, to create a [[conceptualization|frame]], in which certain information is more salient, relevant, inferentially foundational, etc.
