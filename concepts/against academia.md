Sharon Mazer, reflecting on kayfabe and academia, writes:

> All of this is by way of saying that while universities are staged as meritocracies—may the best idea win!—the academic process can be seen as highly codified exchanges between antagonists whose postures are value-laden and whose differences can sometimes appear more metaphoric than tangible.

Skepticism toward institutional knowledge and consensus-making has increased during the pandemic. Patrick Collison: 

> This year, we’ve come to better appreciate the fallibility and shortcomings of numerous well-established institutions (“masks don’t work”)… while simultaneously entrenching more heavily mechanisms that assume their correctness (“removing COVID misinformation”).

# C. Shalizi: review of Susan Haack, Manifesto of a Passionate Moderate

> She has been driven to go public as an essayist by a motive which has probably inspired many more scholars than have confessed to it, viz., impatience with other scholars' rubbish.

[...]

> Take, for instance, the idea of feminist epistemology. In a sane world, this would have been aborted nearly twenty years ago by Janet Radcliffe Richards's observation that "some men are quite as capable of logical thinking and scientific investigation as women." As it stands, feminists of sense like Haack are reduced to patiently explaining that there really isn't any tie between feminism and epistemology, pointing out that the "passes for" fallacy (e.g., "The Nazi cosmic ice theory has passed for a reliable scientific finding but is bunk, therefore reliable scientific findings are all bunk" --- not one of Haack's examples) is a fallacy, and insisting that making up congenial facts and findings isn't even politically expedient. It's depressing to think that there's anyone at all, sharper than a sack of wet mice, who needs to be taught such things; unfortunately, having read many of the authors Haack is chastising, I can testify that, in the words of the poet, she's not making this up.

# C. T. Nguyen 2020: The gamification of academic life

> academic life has recently come to be ruled by quantified metrics for research quality—like citation rates and impact factors. These metrics may not have explicitly been designed to produce gamification among researchers. Conceivably, they arose from the bureaucratic need to collate information, or in university administrators’ quest to make more objective-sounding decisions about faculty hiring and promotion. But the clear, simple, and quantified nature of such metrics can also foster game-like motivations. Metrics, after all, look a lot like points. They offer some of the pleasures of [[concepts/games]] when we pursue them wholeheartedly.

# Anon: The case for professional science critics

> In the popular imagination, science operates something like a priesthood: scientists enter elite institutions as novices and emerge years later as full-fledged representatives of The Truth... The reality is that science, at least as it is practiced today, is actually much more like the film or music industry. Although the analogy is far from perfect, individual scientists in academia bear a strong resemblance to film directors. Devoted to their vision, they marshall their forces, bringing together diverse elements into a controlled chaos, and produce scholarly outputs (i.e. academic papers) which bear their name, but aren't singularly theirs. Like most directors, however, academics are beholden to the broader industry, and all but an elite few must perpetually seek out more funding, in many cases taking work that would not be their first choice in order to be able to fund a different project that is closer to their true artistic/scientific vision.

> [Peer review] is best thought of as a kind of preview screening, testing the waters for how the scholarly community will respond to an article, and providing feedback on which aspects the authors should tweak if they want to increase their impact. In the worst cases, peer review can act like a kind of layperson audience, pushing all products towards a generic pablum that satisfies a conventionally accepted formulaic structure but doesn't push any creative boundaries or provide any novel insight.

# Daniel Kahneman: Introduction to Gary Klein

> In the US, the word "applied" tends to diminish anything academic it touches. Add the word to the name of any academic discipline, from mathematics and statistics to psychology, and you find lowered [[status]].  The attitude changed briefly during World War II, when the best academic psychologists rolled up their sleeves to contribute to the war effort. I believe it was not an accident that the 15 years following the war were among the most productive in the history of the discipline.  Old methods were discarded, old methodological taboos were dropped, and common sense prevailed over stale theoretical disputes.

> looks at people who are good at their job as they exercise their skills, sometimes in life-and-death situations, and he reports what he sees in clear and eloquent prose.  When you read his descriptions of real experts at work, you feel that it is the job of theorists to accommodate what he has seen – instead of doing what we often do, which is to scan the "real world" (when we think of it at all) for illustrations of our theoretical notions.
