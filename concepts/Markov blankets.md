"[A] non-trivial property of life is its propensity to form multi-level and multi-scale structures of structures."

# Kirchoff, Parr, Palacios, Friston, Kiverstein 2018: The Markov blankets of life

> This work addresses the autonomous organization of biological systems. It does so by considering the boundaries of biological systems, from individual cells to Home sapiens, in terms of the presence of  [[Markov blankets]] under the active inference scheme—a corollary of the free energy principle. A Markov blanket defines the boundaries of a system in a statistical sense. Here we consider how a collective of  Markov blankets can self-assemble into a global system that itself has a Markov blanket; thereby providing an illustration of how autonomous systems can be understood as having layers of nested and self-sustaining boundaries. This allows us to show that: (i) any living system is a Markov blanketed system and (ii) the boundaries of such systems need not be co-extensive with the biophysical boundaries of a living organism. In other words, autonomous systems are hierarchically composed of Markov blankets of  Markov blankets—all the way down to individual cells, all the way up to you and me, and all the way out to include elements of the local environment.

The Markov blanket is "a statistical partitioning of a system into internal states and external states, where the blanket itself consists of the states that separate the two." A state refers to "any variable that locates the system at a particular point in state space; for example, the position and momentum of all the particles constituting a thermodynamic system." This blanket mediates exchanges between inside and outside (see "semi-permeable boundaries"). There is an external state "hidden" behind a Markov blanket (see the entry for [[Noumenality]], or philosophical "beyond"), and then there is the sensory state which is _caused_, but not fully compressed in, the sensory state. The sensory state in turn influences the internal state which organizes into an action which in turn affects the external state which began the process. "Internal and external states can therefore be understood as influencing one another in a continuous and reciprocal fashion."

> Statistically, the existence of a Markov blanket means external states are conditionally independent of internal states, and vice versa, as internal and external states can only influence each other via sensory and active states.

## Markov blankets as identity

Living organisms, or "systems," are "composed of Markov blankets of Markov blankets—reaching all the way down to cellular organelles and DNA and all the way out to elements of the environment. [...] Without possessing a Markov blanket a cell would no longer be, as there would be no way by which to distinguish it from everything else."

> This is to say that, if the Markov blanket of a cell deteriorates, there will be no evidence for its existence, or it will cease to exist. 

The boundary is an instrument for goals—why does a company not just anyone log onto their computers? Constituent subagents of the superorganism typically have incentives at least broadly aligned with the superorganism's success; outsiders do not. In order to have or actualize goals, one must have a coordinated, coherent identity with which to act, as well as a homeostasis with which minimize entropy:

> Biological systems have a capacity to maintain low-entropy distributions over their internal states (and their Markov blanket) despite living their lives in changing and uncertain circumstances.

The authors go on to cite Varela et al:

> A cell stands out of a molecular soup by creating the boundaries that set it apart from that which it is not. Metabolic processes within the cell determine these boundaries. In this way the cell emerges as a figure out of a chemical background. Should this process of self-production be interrupted, the cellular components... gradually diffuse back into molecular soup.

To _live_ or _exist_ can be meaningfully construed as "a process of boundary conservation." This is the reccurent process of "autopoietic self-generation," which so long as the system is living "enforces a difference between [the] living system and everything else." 

# Examples

> The water boatman is an example of an autonomous system, the internal states of which comprise environmental aspects [31]. The water boatman is ‘able to breathe underwater by trapping air bubbles (plastrons) using tiny hairs in the abdomen. The bubbles even refill with oxygen due to the differences in partial pressure provoked by respiration and potentially can work indefinitely. They provide access to longer periods underwater thanks to a mediated regulation of environmental coupling (which is nevertheless potentially riskier than normal breathing)’ [31, p. 17]. This example highlights the fact that some creatures incorporate elements of their niche that jointly contribute to—or preserve—their structural integrity over time. Hence, the bubbles in which the boatman is wrapped are best conceived of as elements constituting the boatman's Markov blanket. This follows because without the bubbles the water boatman would not be able to minimize variational free energy. It is in this sense that the water boatman plus its self-orchestrated air bubbles constitute a Markov blanket the boundaries of which reach all the way out to include parts of the environment.
