Machiavelli 1514: "Men nearly always follow the tracks made by others and proceed in their affairs by imitation."

Jefferson, _Notes on the State of Virginia_: "Man is an imitative animal. This quality is the germ of all education in him. From his cradle to his grave he is learning to do what he sees others do."

> Gibson and Hoglund (1992) describe evidence that animals imitate each other in choice of mate and territories; for example, female guppies are more likely to choose males to mate with whom they have observed being selected by previous females. The propensity to imitate is presumably an evolutionary adaptation that has promoted survival over thousands of generations by allowing individuals to take advantage of the hard-won information of others.
