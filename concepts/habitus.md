Rowe 2017: " [[pragmatism|Pragmatist]] [[habit]] is, like habitus, an unconscious pattern of embodied dispositions."

# The linguistic habitus

## [[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]] 1991: Language & Symbolic Power

> On the one hand, there are the socially constructed dispositions of the linguistic habitus, which imply a certain propensity to speak and to say determinate things (the expressive interat) and a certain capacity to speak, which involves both the linguistic capacity to generate an infinite number of grammatically correct discourses, and the social capacity to use this competence adequately in a determinate situation. On the other hand, there are the structures of the linguistic market, which impose themselves as a system of specific sanctions and censorships.

> ...as long as they are unaware of the limits that constitute their science, linguists have no choice but to search desperately in language for something that is actually inscribed in the social relations within which it functions, or to engage in a sociology without knowing it, that is, with the risk of discovering, in grammar itself, something that their spontaneous sociology has unwittingly imported into it.

Habitus plays out in style, that "individual deviation from the linguistic norm": a "being-perceived which exists only in relation to perceiving subjects, endowed with the diacritical dispositions which enable them to make _distinctions_ between different _ways of saying_... style, whether it be a matter of poetry as compared with prose or of the diction of a particular (social, sexual, or generational) class compared with that of another class, exists only in relation to agents endowed with schemes of perception and appreciation that enable them to constitute it as a set of systematic differences, apprehended syncretically.

# Pressure on preferences

## Perry 2017: Weaponized Sacredness

> People's expressed, public preferences are a function of both their interior preferences and the perceived acceptability of revealing them; other people's expressed preferences serve as a guide for measuring acceptability. So people's expressed preferences are in part a function of other people's expressed preferences. Under certain circumstances, when the distribution of preferences is right, a domino effect may be begun by a single dissenter, toppling the status quo of [[preference falsification]]. One dissenter may embolden others, and then together with them give the impression that it is acceptable for others to express their true preferences.
