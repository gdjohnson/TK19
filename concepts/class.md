## Henderson 2020: Everything I Know About Elite America I Learned From ‘Fresh Prince’ and ‘West Wing’ (NYT)

> Along the way, I’ve learned about the complicated ways that class interacts with taste, and what different social classes view as desirable. What I’ve come to realize, as I reflect on different influences in my life, is that the television I’ve watched has made me a different person than I would otherwise have been; choices I’ve made have been guided to a large degree by what TV has taught me about what constitutes a good life. Looking back, I can see that my decisions stemmed from a set of values — but whose? I thought I was building the life I desired, using fictional stories as a road map. Now I wonder how these stories shaped what I desired all along.

> For people near the bottom, social class is defined by money — in this regard, I was right in line with my peers when I was growing up. The middle class, though, doesn’t just value money; equally important is education.

> One year before my enlistment was over, but before I knew where I’d be headed next, I attended the Warrior-Scholar Project, an organization that hosts “academic boot camps” to teach military veterans how to succeed in higher education. I learned a lot: how to write an essay, tips for studying, making the most of office hours.
> 
> Equally useful, though, were the insights I gleaned from the unstructured time. The tutors were either students or graduates of top universities like Yale, Dartmouth and Amherst. Between lessons and writing workshops, the other students and I would hang out with them; sometimes I’d overhear them chatting with one another.
> 
> I became close with one, a recent Yale graduate. One evening, I saw him watching something on his MacBook. He told me it was “The West Wing.”
> 
> I’d never seen this show, nor did I know anyone who’d watched it. My military friends watched “Two and a Half Men,” “Family Guy,” “Game of Thrones.” But when another tutor overheard him recommend the show to me, she nodded vigorously, saying I had to watch it.
> 
> I took the recommendation seriously. This was the first show that two Ivy League graduates had ever recommended to me. It suddenly seemed important to understand.
> 
> The more I watched, the more the characters reminded me of the Warrior-Scholar Project tutors. Characters like Josh Lyman and C.J. Cregg were educated at elite universities and, despite their flaws, tried to live up to their moral principles. They engaged in fierce debate with political foes, but respected them too. The characters who staffed the Bartlet administration were highly educated, extremely witty, clever and idealistic. It made me wonder: Was this show so popular among elite college graduates because they saw aspirational versions of themselves in it? And if this was how they aspired to be, was this also how I should aspire to be?
> 
> The more I saw, the more I learned what I wanted; the shows I chose to watch, in turn, reflected my desire to build a better life for myself, and I took my cues from them on how to construct it. Either stay like this, I thought, as I gazed at the TV, or try to live like that.
> 
> What I can’t quite disentangle is whether it taught me how to get what I had always wanted or taught me what to want.

> Yet there is a quite unintended effect of enumerating, and I call
this subversive. Enumeration demands kinds of things or people to
count. Counting is hungry for categories. Many of the categories we
now use to describe people are byproducts of the needs of enumeration.
What could be more inevitable than the class struggle about which
Marx hectored us? Yet the social classes are not something into which
a society is intrinsically sorted. On the contrary, it is the early nineteenth-century counting-bureaucracies that designed the class structure
in terms of which we view society. After 1800, there was a radical
shift in the ways in which people were classified in terms of occupation. You might say that came because new occupations arose with the
new industrialization. Of course. But that they should be classified in
the ways in which we group them was not some inevitable feature of
the organization of factories. On the contrary, bureaucrats-even the
very Factory Inspectors or people from the Board of Trade-designed
easily countable classifications into which everybody had to fall-and
thenceforth did.
