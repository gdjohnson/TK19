## Steven Moore

> The standard history of the novel—the one that [Myers, Peck, Franzen, and readers like them] seem to believe in, and the one I was taught as an English major in the early 1970s—goes something like this: The novel was born in 18th-century England, the offspring of a questionable marriage between fiction and nonfiction (Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe and Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels pretended to be true travel accounts), gained respectability with Samuel Richardson’s epistolary novels named after prudish virgins (Pamela, Clarissa), sowed some wild oats (Fielding, Smollett, Sterne) and went through a goth phase (Walpole, Radcliffe, Mary Shelley) before settling down into domestic life ([[Jane Austen|Austen]]) and becoming the preferred entertainment of the middle class. Scott invented the historical novel with Waverly, while over in France Balzac launched the realistic novel… The novel matured during this time, dramatizing the great moral issues of the day (Dickens, Eliot, and Hardy in England; Hugo, Flaubert, and Zola in France; Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, and Turgenev in Russia; Hawthorne James, and Dreiser in the United States)...

To which Moore intervenes:

> The novel has been around since at least the 4th century BCE (Xenophon’s Cyropaedia) and flourished in the Mediterranean area until the coming of the Christian Dark Ages. The earliest novels were Greek romances and Latin satires, where the plot was a mere convenience that allowed the author to engage in rhetorical display, literary criticism, sociopolitical commentary, digressions, and so on. It was an elastic form that made room for interpolated poems, stories within stories, pornography, and parodies, where the realistic and fantastic blend together.

> "The model for those who thought that high literature should be allusively obscure and complex,” Robert Irwin suggests, is not Joyce but the 11th century Arabic fictionist al-Hariri [of Basra]; a Sanskrit scholar would nominate the 7th-century novelist Bāna for that distinction.
