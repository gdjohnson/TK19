# Introduction: the Freudian Gospel

In [[F. L. Allen]]’s _Only Yesterday_, a contemporaneous history of [[the twenties]], Allen writes about the revolution in manners and morals that began to pick up in the early years of the decade:

> Like all revolutions, this one was stimulated by foreign propoganda. It came, however, not from Moscow, but from Vienna. Sigmund [[people/Sigmund Freud|Freud]] had published his first book of psychoanalysis at the end of the nineteenth century, and he and Jung had lectured to American psychologists as early as 1909, but it was not until after the war that the Freudian gospel began to circulate to a marked extent among the American lay public.

And yet somewhere along the way, the analyst’s concepts of libido, drive, and sublimation had been distorted. [[people/Sigmund Freud|Freud]] has been converted to gospel. Allen describes the ideological atmosphere:

> Sex, it appeared, was the central and pervasive force which moved mankind. Almost every human motive was attributable to it: if you were patriotic or liked the violin, you were in the grip of sex—in a sublimated form. The first requirement of mental health was to have an uninhibited sex life. If you would be well and happy, you must obey your libido.

As those more familiar with psychoanalytic writings know, these “lessons” of [[people/Sigmund Freud|Freud]] and Jung hang from the originals as if from a thread; only a scraggling similarity of form and shared signifiers connects them. But such, Allen writes, “was the Freudian gospel as it imbedded itself in the American mind after being filtered through the successive minds of interpreters and popularizers and guileless readers and people who had heard guileless readers talk about it.” Our parable is at once hopeful and hopeless: Psychoanalysis had not converted the American public, so much as the American public had converted psychoanalysis.

In the UK, the game of telephone is known as “Chinese whispers,” a more elegant handle than the American “telephone.” The premise is very simple: an auditory-semantic signal subject to an iterated process of interpretation and propagation. Your best guess of their representation of their best guess of… ad nauseam.

In real-life games of telephone, children can often convey messages around the assembled circles with very little corruption. But that dynamic changes once there are one or two children who, consciously or unconsciously, desire to “throw” the game. Perhaps they are “merely” bad actors; perhaps they’re clever with a streak of rebelliousness, and have chosen to eschew the purported goal of the game (lossless transmission) and instead achieve the actual motivating force of the game (the humor of lossy transmission). One or two such actors, the message will become legitimately garbled, in large part because each child is dependent on the child before him; there is no other source of truth.

We can see here some crucial differences between the game of telephone and what we can call the “[[telephone effect]]” in public discourse. For one, public discourse is not a linear set of nodes in the same way. Often, people will discuss an idea with many interlocutors, and each discussion acts as a “check” against their initial understanding of a concept or stance. This is the good news.

The bad news is that there are a host of effects present in public discourse, and not a children’s circle, that increase the lossiness of transmission. These are: the Procrustean stretching or amputation of concepts to fit one’s already-implicit worldview and experiences; the role of self-interested actors who wish to “sell” an idea and will profit most off distorted versions of it; the difficulty of apprehending, neutrally interpreting, and then conveying in full complex ideas as they were understood; and the constant problem of personal languages (different mappings between signifier and signified). Real-world discourse is not merely a cast of actors listening to a sentence and repeating it, rather, a set of concepts must be interpreted, internalized, and then re-explained; each time, the form and semantic structure undergo significant changes even as the speaker attempts to keep the “content” of the message intact.

# Corruption in academia

One would like to think that, while the public might be vulnerable to such corruptions—alongside general hysteria and the writings of Malcolm Gladwell—academia can and does a better job of pinning down terms, formally defining concepts, peer-reviewing deviant usages, and generally providing more accurate, charitable, rigorous interpreters and conveyors of meaning. Instead we get a very different lesson, courtesy of Kate Bush.

Here’s the start of a galaxy-brain oscillation you might recognize:
1. The Eskimos have 50 words for snow.
2. “The Eskimos have 50 words for snow” is a myth.

If you’re familiar with these memes, you know what’s coming next. Cue Regier, Carstensen, Kemp 2016, “Languages Support Efficient Communication about the Environment“:

> Franz Boas observed that certain Eskimo languages have unrelated forms for subtypes of snow (e.g. aput: snow on the ground, qana: falling snow), and thus subdivide the notion of snow more finely than English does. He suggested that such cross-language variation in the grouping of ideas into named categories “must to a certain extent depend upon the chief interests of a people.” Boas’ Eskimo example was repeated by Whorf, and was subsequently exaggerated through popularization, leading to grossly inflated claims about the number of words for snow in Eskimo languages. Through this exaggeration and resulting critique, the snow example has acquired an air of unseriousness, and it tends to be avoided by many scholars. However, recent work has suggested some empirical support for the original claim prior to its distortion, motivating a broader re-examination across languages, and greater theoretical attention.

What we see here is a very simple dynamic: An idea is infectiously picked up by the public; their endorsement and exaggeration (telephonic corruption) discourages serious discussion or investigation of the phenomenon. Eventually, you get thinkers arguing that the very idea Eskimos could or do have a higher-than-average number of descriptors for snow is itself an invention, a legend, fullstop. They have ceased arguing against the exaggeration because the exaggeration has fully supplanted the original (which now has few serious supporters left on account of its growing common-knowledge stigma). And a very simple truth—that categorization and conceptual systems reflect local environments of language users—is lost in the blizzard.

Often, the public need not be involved; as Clarak Burke writes, "as Bourdieu is increasingly the 'go to' theorist, his concepts are used without the necessary theoretical consideration or empirical reflection required." In this way, the ideas are diluted long before they reach the public's shores. [[Sarah Perry]] "Ignorance, a skilled practice" provides the best example of how citation chains can slowly corrode the truth, via decentralized "nudging" and Procrustean maneuvers. First, a social psychology finding gets picked up by interested parties and further "fitted” to the case they are trying to make, for instance, Lenore Walker’s 1979 “The Battered Woman,” which cites the study in discussion. Each time a social science finding is re-appropriated, it is used in a way which is mostly honest but still adaptive—it is nudged, slowly, to some other belief entirely. A concept is formalized by a social scientist in a way pragmatically useful to a specific situation at hand; forty years later, it’s adopted by institutions for use in situations to which it is ill-fitted; this is even done with an awareness that it the formalization is ill-fitting, but a deep deference in our society for formalized, universal knowledge—which the scholar’s original, indexical factoring has masqueraded as—wins out nonetheless.

# Commonplace
[[931774D]] 2021, "Afternotes III: The Lonely Crowd Within" on [[David Reisman]]'s _Lonely Crowd_:

> the books popularity became both a blessing and a curse. His ideas got caricaturized in popular culture, and broad swaths of folks in academia began looking at him suspiciously. Indeed, he is rarely even mentioned today, or his work seriously engaged with. But historian Rupert Wilkerson provides a corrective to the record on his importance

Michael Pollan on _The Secret Life of Plants_, New Yorker:
> In the ensuing years, several legitimate plant scientists tried to reproduce the “Backster effect” without success. Much of the science in “The Secret Life of Plants” has been discredited. But the book had made its mark on the culture. Americans began talking to their plants and playing Mozart for them, and no doubt many still do. This might seem harmless enough ...But in the view of many plant scientists “The Secret Life of Plants” has done lasting damage to their field. According to Daniel Chamovitz, an Israeli biologist who is the author of the recent book “What a Plant Knows,” Tompkins and Bird “stymied important research on plant behavior as scientists became wary of any studies that hinted at parallels between animal senses and plant senses.” Others contend that “The Secret Life of Plants” led to “self-censorship” among researchers seeking to explore the “possible homologies between neurobiology and phytobiology”; that is, the possibility that plants are much more intelligent and much more like us than most people think—capable of cognition, communication, information processing, computation, learning, and memory.

Guddemi 2006: "Breaking the Concept of Power":
> Any validity that the idea of power may have depends, in Foucault’s practice (perhaps even morethan in his theoretical formulations), on a case-by-case analysis of the historical and, dare I say, ethnographic particulars of what is being looked at. Unfortunately, clinging to the term power in such variable usages and situations can lead to a kind of proteanconcept which, more in the hands of some of Foucault’s followers than in his own, can yield an intoxicating illusion of explanation and of causation. This illusion is produced by a kind of academic description and categorization, which explains the precise by the vague and the specific by the general. Contemporary applications of the concept of “power” sometimes seem to use the term as if it were a free-floating agent of its own,rather than a type of relation among agents. In the worst case, this has led some in the post-Foucaultian traditions to a use of the concept of “power” as if it were, in the words of the anthropologist P. Steven Sangren, “a kind of ubiquitous, transcendent, omnipotent force... that becomes coterminous with all of social reality” (Sangren, 1995, p. 27). Sangren also remarks, in the vein of my remarks above, that “the concept comes to occupy a position of transcendent agency,” one which “exercises a seductive ideological power” of its own (p. 27).

# Precedents

Susan Haack, _New Criterion_ 1997:

> Perhaps you know the old joke about the soldiers passing a message down the line— first man to second, “send reinforcements, we’re going to advance”; next-to-last man to last, “send three-and-fourpence, we’re going to a dance.” Well, the history of pragmatism is like that—only more so.

> It has probably never happened that any philosopher has attempted to give a general name to his own doctrine without that name's soon acquiring in common philosophical usage, a signification much broader than was originally intended.

Phil Tetlock, _Superforecasting_:

> But I realized that as word of my work spread, its apparent meaning was mutating. What my research had shown was that the average expert had done little better than guessing on many of the political and economic questions I had posed. “Many” does not equal all. It was easiest to beat chance on the shortest-range questions that only required looking one year out, and accuracy fell off the further out experts tried to forecast—approaching the dart-throwing-chimpanzee level three to five years out. That was an important finding. It tells us something about the limits of expertise in a complex world—and the limits on what it might be possible for even superforecasters to achieve. But as in the children’s game of “telephone,” in which a phrase is whispered to one child who passes it on to another, and so on, and everyone is shocked at the end to discover how much it has changed, the actual message was garbled in the constant retelling and the subtleties were lost entirely. The message became “all expert forecasts are useless,” which is nonsense. Some variations were even cruder—like “experts know no more than chimpanzees.” My research had become a backstop reference for nihilists who see the future as inherently unpredictable and know-nothing populists who insist on preceding “expert” with “so-called.”

# Motivated alteration of theory to advance agendas

John Nerst, review of _Cynical Theories_:
> Pluckrose and Lindsay go on to describe the evolution of “postmodernism” from the 1960’s to today. They split it into three phases, calling the first “high deconstructive postmodernism”, the second “applied postmodernism”, and the third and final one “reified postmodernism”... In the authors’ story, as postmodernism evolved it devolved. It became less high-minded and less subtle. It eased up on the impenetrable jargon its earlier iterations had been known for. It got more concrete and more activist. By the 2010’s it had turned into something more like an orthodoxy than the sophisticated, contrarian nihilism of the early days... [The authors] describe this evolution as the result of deliberate choices, made to justify and make possible certain activism that one wanted to pursue, rather than of following the deconstructive logic to its natural conclusion[6]. The high deconstructives took their developed ideas seriously and applied their corrosive philosophy more consistently, but that breaks everything and won’t do if you want to achieve specific political goals.
> Postmodernism is frequently simplified, vulgarized and turned into a strawman by its opponents. It is also frequently simplified, vulgarized and turned into a strawman by its proponents.

[6:12 PM] snav: Reich won a pyrrhic victory because he "won" the cultural war but his terms lost their intended meanings, goals distorted by societal game of telephone
[6:13 PM] snav: whereas [[people/Sigmund Freud|Freud]] "lost" the public war but remains read and used with rather high fidelity, at least in the intellectual world
[6:13 PM] snav: [[people/Sigmund Freud|Freud]] sort of towers over Reich tho
[6:14 PM] snav: Reich is sort of a young plucky revolutionary manifesto writer, [[people/Sigmund Freud|Freud]] is the old wise balanced grandfather
[8:49 PM] suspended reason: "social game of telephone" is a good handle
[8:50 PM] suspended reason: I wonder if there's an even more compressed/descriptive name
[8:50 PM] suspended reason: What, we talked about this w/r/t [[people/Sigmund Freud|Freud]]'s sexuality and how it "hit" the States in the 20s, where pretty soon everyone was going around saying it was "repressive" not to be having casual sex all the time lmao
[8:51 PM] suspended reason: Chinese whispers is the british name for American "game of telephone"

[9:14 PM] suspended reason: damn, [[structuralism]] makes so much more sense as a response to garbage existentialism
[9:16 PM] suspended reason: something's coming together for me about dialectic and signals/correctives.... Plato responding to the Sophists.... an idea gets watered down (telephone) and then another side has easy prey to rip into....
[10:02 PM] suspended reason: so, if most of the movements have a core of insight but have a "dominant bent" which gets outsized and then challenged by a new dominant paradigm, what would it look like to pull em out of their dialectic form—their contingent, situated-in-opposition-to-previous-arguments form—and find a way to coordinate each group's valuable ideas instead of contrasting them?
[10:03 PM] suspended reason: I'd imagine many pragmatic e.g. sociologists and critics already do this, but

## 5/30/20

[12:18 PM] suspended reason: "small step size" of inferential distance kinda seems like what you're talking about
[12:20 PM] snav: i... think i agree with his critique, but im having trouble processing his language
[12:21 PM] snav: idk what step size means
[12:22 PM] snav: i definitely agree with the "bias in favor of 'compact' arguments" and actually i do think that's one of the main flaws
[12:23 PM] snav: compact arguments tend to require little conceptual reorientation, the result is that rats never end up interrogating ideas very deeply
[12:24 PM] snav: this is also Gabe's big issue fwiw
[12:25 PM] snav: he refuses to engage with any arguments that threaten his preexisting configuration of ideas, so if it's anything more than "compact" (i.e. relying on existing conceptual structures), he rejects it immediately
[12:26 PM] snav: i also see this a lot in the SSC comments
[12:28 PM] snav: IME rats will argue about studies and methodologies all day long but they will never get into the conceptual interrogation level we reach in this discord
[12:41 PM] suspended reason: sorry was in the shower
[12:41 PM] suspended reason: yeah his language is a bit tricky
[12:42 PM] suspended reason: FWIW, the support of Occam's razor-type explanations is a major theoretical touchstone and not just an unquestioned assumption
[12:42 PM] suspended reason: Not arguing, just trying to put all the pieces on the table for understanding
[12:43 PM] suspended reason: One takeaway Yud has from the "Linda the feminist banker" conjunction fallacy type studies is that the more specificity we add to narratives, the more compelling they seem, even as they become less probabilistically likely
[12:43 PM] suspended reason: And so a coherent complex gestalt has an inherent attraction to human beings over simpler explanations
[12:44 PM] suspended reason: He's written some unorthodox supports of Occam's razor which I haven't delved into enough to know whether they're on-point or not, but they're actually seen as one of his original contributions to discourse
[12:45 PM] suspended reason: The idea that most complex mysterious things are the results of very simple underlying dynamics & emergence is a touchstone of rationalist thinking but it's not an unwitting bias, I guess, is all I'm trying to say—it's at least a considered intellectual stance, regardless of whether it's helpful or harmful
[12:45 PM] suspended reason: Also, hmm
[12:45 PM] suspended reason: I wonder how much this is fair to ask
[12:45 PM] suspended reason: Because I get your critique of "harmful ways of thinking"
[12:46 PM] suspended reason: But I'm also wary of the telephone problem: using SSC commenters (the less-sophisticated adopters of an ideology) to critique the ideology itself is exactly what we object to w/r/t e.g. bad poststructuralism, bad Freudianism in the 20s, etc
[12:47 PM] suspended reason: so I'm trying to figure out how to meaningfully separate it—poststructuralism teaches garbage habits of mind if you're not super sophisticated about it; going around being like "everything's constructed! everything is oppression!" is arguably much worse than LessWrong rationalism
