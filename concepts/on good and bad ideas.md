## Cosma Shalizi, review of Susan Haack's _Manifesto of a Passionate Moderate_

> One might almost as well occupy one's time slaying conspiracy theorists, creationists or Objectivists as feminist epistemologists and vulgar pragmatists.

> many young (and even not so young) scholars in the humanities are tempted to buy into bad doctrines because they look like the only ones dealing with serious and interesting topics. To end this temptation, they need to see not only that those doctrines are whacked out of their skulls, but that there are sensible and substantial alternatives. Haack doesn't provide any of her own, and, worse, doesn't connect with or even point out the really sophisticated and attention-worthy scholarship on these issues. 

> Perhaps I could sum this up by saying that I wish she'd written something more engaged (however combatively) with people and ideas worth the bother, and less like Thomas Browne's Pseudodoxia Epidemica, debunking vulgar errors...  In such cases, as Mencken said, one horse-laugh is worth ten thousand syllogisms. Alas: Haack is short on horse-laughs.

## Eliezer Yudkowsky, introduction to David Stove's "What Is Wrong With Our Thoughts"

> The astute reader will of course find themselves objecting to Stove's notion [of nosology,] that we should be catologuing every possible way to do philosophy wrong.  It's not like there's some originally pure mode of thought, being tainted by only a small library of poisons.  It's just that there are exponentially more possible crazy thoughts than sane thoughts, c.f. entropy.

> I have also seen instances where nearly an entire field is making some elementary error, which people outside that field can see more clearly, but which they can't communicate to people in that field because they would have to spend years learning enough about the field to write a paper, probably with half a year's worth of experimental work, and not get rejected, even if their insight is something that could be communicated in a single sentence.

## The Pessimistic View: Most human thought is "deranged"

### David Stove, "What Is Wrong With Our Thoughts"

Stove proposes, then waffles around, a "nosology" of our thoughts (i.e. an inventory of diseases). At the moment, he writes, we have but two "ways in which thought can go wrong": contingent falsity and self-contradiction. The Logical Positivists, though they failed to make it stick, added a third nosological category: a proposition could be meaningless, if it were not analytic or verifiable. 

> My specimens above were not drawn from the voodoo religion, for example, or from the medicine of Paracelsus, or from the 'philosophy' of William Blake, or from the 'psychotherapy' of Wilhelm Reich. Indeed, in this essay, I will hardly stray at all 'below the belt', that is, to the rank under-parts of human thought: numerology, magic, lives of the gods, lives of the saints, lives of the demons, necromancy or lives of the dead, astrology, spiritualism, Freudianism, etc., etc. __Together, of course, such things as these make up in fact the great bulk of past and present human thought__, and there is more than enough that is wrong with them.

> From an Enlightenment or Positivist point of view, which is Hume's point of view, and mine, __there is simply no avoiding the conclusion that the human race is mad__. There are scarcely any human beings who do not have some lunatic beliefs or other to which they attach great importance. People are mostly sane enough, of course, in the affairs of common life: the getting of food, shelter, and so on. But the moment they attempt any depth or generality of thought, they go mad almost infallibly. The vast majority, of course, adopt the local religious madness, as naturally as they adopt the local dress. But the more powerful minds will, equally infallibly, fall into the worship of some intelligent and dangerous lunatic, such as Plato, or Augustine, or Comte, or Hegel, or Marx.

Stove is a misanthropist, no doubt about it, and cynical about what aggregate humans can and will achieve:

> Genetic engineering aside, given a large aggregation of human beings, and a long time, you cannot reasonably expect rational thought to win. You could as reasonably expect a thousand unbiased dice, all tossed at once, all to come down 'five,' say. There are simply far too many ways, and easy ways, in which human thought can go wrong. Or, put it the other way round: anthropocentrism cannot lose. The jungle will reclaim the clearing (even without heavy infestations of conservationists), darkness will beat the light, not quite always on the local scale, but absolutely always on the large scale.

More interesting is his idea that cognitive biases underly certain philosophical theories:

> Plato, Aquinas, Descartes, Kant, flattered and deluded man that he will live for ever; or that he is not really even a part of the physical universe at all; or that he is the whole point of the existence of the physical universe; or even that the physical universe depends upon, indeed is constituted by, man's thought of it!

The essay less answers the titular question, and more walks in circles around just how difficult it is to tell "sense" from "nonsense," or good from bad thought. Very few philosophers of credit contradict themselves, or make logical mistakes; even verifiability makes only the smallest dent in what Stove perceives as the shortcomings of Hegel, Berkeley, or Plotinus.  

### [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], Truth & Lies in a Non-moral Sense

> Deception, flattering, lying, deluding, talking behind the back, putting up a false front, living in borrowed splendor, wearing a mask, hiding behind convention, playing a role for others and for oneself-in short, a continuous fluttering around the solitary flame of vanity-is so much the rule and the law among men that there is almost nothing which is less comprehensible than how an honest and pure drive for truth could have arisen among them.
