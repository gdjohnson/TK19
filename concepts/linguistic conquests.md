## Reason 2020: Linguistic conquests

_Rationality_, Taleb tells us in _Incerto_, _is what survives_. Period.

_There are two types of rationality_, Yudkowsky tells us in the Sequences: empirical rationality—a Bayesian protocol for updating & maintaining the most accurate possible model of the world—and instrumental rationality—a protocol & set of beliefs that best help us achieve desired ends.

What can we make of their factorings?

Taleb’s approach is more or less analogous to Yudkowsky’s “instrumental rationality.” It is about what _works_. Both Taleb and Yudkowsky acknowledge a divergence between beliefs that are accurate and those that are useful, though in Taleb’s factoring, only the the latter are “truly” rational. (If this sounds like a No True Scotsman, there’s a reason for it: the thinking is damaged.) And to whatever extent we might trust the social sciences, or economics, or folk psychology, there is significant evidence in these discourses of useful self-deception: conceits which are false in the correspondence theory sense but give us a tactical advantage in social life (or in sensations of “meaningness,” for example).

I’d like to call Taleb’s approach to factoring “rationality” the “narrow and conquer” method. Rationality is a word which has been used in many different ways, by many different groups, for many different purposes. Remember: _Something runs through the whole thread—namely the continuous overlapping of those fibres. _This was [[Wittgenstein]], describing the way a category of objects: for example, the category “game” does not have an _essence_, as Plato might have thought, but is made up of a family of related & associated traits that have been bundled together through some combination of self-similarity, historical circumstance, and human pragmatism. Thus one thinker, attempting to define a game, might make an argument which fits _board games_ closely, while another would define the game anchored on a conception of the “prototypal” [[sports]] game, and both would claim they had discovered the true, constituent properties of the “game” broadly—only, in reality, to have factored a sub-cluster of the concept. 

(Quick glossary for the out-of-towners: Rosch's [prototype theory](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/prototype-theory) in CogSci ≈ [Zadeh's](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-fuzzy/) [[fuzzy]] concepts in philosophy ≈ [[Wittgenstein]]'s "[family of senses](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2018/12/07/something-runs-through-the-whole-thread/)" ≈ Yudkowsky's rationalist factoring "[cluster in thingspace](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WBw8dDkAWohFjWQSk/the-cluster-structure-of-thingspace).") 

Taleb’s approach is to pick a sub-cluster and let its definition stand in for the concept in entirety: instrumental rationality is the only “true” rationality. This is a common move for Taleb: elsewhere, he decides the only_ true _courage is selfless; acts of bravery done for personal gain are _not_ courageous, which enables him to make an argument that all courage is inherently prudent (since it involves a personal sacrifice that, while costly, is small in scope relative to the potential consequences of not acting, as in the case of risking one’s life to save a classroom of schoolchildren). Tyler Cowen, meanwhile, seems to believe that courage is only a virtue when it is paired with prudence. Is Cowen’s belief redundant?

Let’s return to Yudkowsky’s distinction between empirical and instrumental rationality. This approach to carving language consists of noticing that a cluster in thingspace has, itself, constituent subclusters which are organized through an internal self-tightness; it opts toward giving each of these clusters its own name, in the form of a qualifier to the umbrella concept. (Such a form is not necessary, but convention.) Going forward in these posts, I’ll call this the “divide and conquer” method.

As we will see, many historical & contemporary philosophers have unwittingly worked as lexicographers, using narrow-and-conquer methods to claim a “discovery” as to the “true” nature of a concept when no such discovery has been made. 

## Reason 2020: Conceptual engineering, the revolution in philosophy you've never heard of

I've written previously on various blogs about what I call "linguistic conquests"—epistemic strategies in which a polysemous concept—the product of a massive decentralized system of speakers operating in different environments across space and time, who using metaphor and inference have stretched its meaning into new applications—is considered to have been wrestled into understanding, when what in fact has occurred is a redefinition or refactoring of the original which moves it down a weight class, makes it easier to pin to the mat.

I distinguished between two types of linguistic conquest. First, the "narrow and conquer" method, where a specific sub-sense of a concept is taken to be its "true" or "essential" meaning, the core which defines its "concept-ness." To give an example from discourse, Taleb defines the concept _rationality_ as "What survives, period." The second style I termed "divide and conquer," where multiple sub-senses are distinguished and named in an attempt to preserve all relevant sub-senses while also gaining the ability to talk about one _specific_ sub-sense. To give an example from discourse, Yudkowsky separates rationality into epistemic _rationality_—the pursuit of increasingly predictive models which are "true" in a loose correspondence sense—and instrumental rationality—the pursuit of models which lead to in-the-world flourishing, e.g. via adaptive self-deception or magical thinking. (This second sense is much like Taleb's: rationality as what _works_.)

Conquests by narrowing throw out all the richly bundled senses of a concept while keeping only the immediately useful—it's wasteful in its parsimony. It leaves not even a ghost of these other senses' past, advertising itself as the original bundled whole while erasing the richness which once existed there. It leads to verbal disputes, term confusion, talking past each other. It impoverishes our language.

Division preserves the original, bundled concept in full, documenting and preserving the different senses rather than purging all but the one. It advertises this history; _intended_ meaning, _received_ meaning—the qualifier indicates that these are hypernyms of "meaning," which encompasses them both. Not just this, but the qualifier indicates the _character_ of the subsense in a way that a narrowed umbrella original never will. Our understanding of the original has been improved even as our instrumental ability to wield its subsenses grows. Instead of stranding itself from discourse at large, the divided term has _clarified_ discourse at large.

Chalmers, for his part, sees no difference between "heteronymous" and "homonymous" conceptual engineering—his own terms for two-word-type maneuvers (he gives as an example Ned Block factoring "access consciousness" from consciousness) and one-word-type maneuvers. One must imagine this apathy can only come from not having thought the difference through. He gives some nod—"homonymous conceptual engineering, especially for theoretical purposes, can be very confusing, with all these multiple meanings floating around." Forgive him—he's speaking out loud—but not fully.

Ironically, divide-and-conquer methods are, quite literally, the solution to verbal disputes, while narrow-and-conquer methods, meanwhile, are, while not the sole cause of verbal disputes, one of its primary causes. Two discourses believe they have radically different stances on the nature of a phenomenon, only to realize they have radically different stances on the factoring of a word.

Another way of framing this: you must always preserve the full extensional coverage. It's no good to carve terms and then discard the unused chunks—like land falling into the sea, lessening habitable ground, collapsing under people's feet. I'm getting histrionic but bear with me: If you plan on only maintaining a patch of your estate, you must cede the rest of the land to the commons. Plain and simple, an old world philosophy.

(Division also answers Strawson's challenge: if you divide a topic into agreeably constituent sense-parts, and give independent answers for each sense, you have given an accounting of the full topic. Dave, by contrast, can only respond: "Sure, I'm changing the topic—here's an interesting topic.")

## Stevenson 1938: Persuasive Definitions

Stevenson separates the _emotive_ and _conceptual_ meanings of a handle, and terms "persuasive definitions" (PDs) those attempts to redefine the conceptual meaning while maintaining the emotive or affective valence of a word.

On the other hand is the _persuasive quasi-definition_, in which the emotive meaning is altered while the conceptual meaning is kept intact. 

### Huxley 1944: Eyeless in Gaza:

> I always love that kind of argument. The contrary of a thing isn't the contrary; oh, dear me, no! It's the thing itself, but as it truly is. Ask any die-hard what conservatism is; he'll tell you that it's true socialism. And the brewers' trade papers: they're full of articles about the beauty of true temperance. Ordinary temperance is just gross refusal to drink; but true temperance, true temperance is something much more refined. True temperance is a bottle of claret with each meal and three double whiskies after dinner.

### Orwell 1946: Politics & the English Language

> Words of [the vague] kind are often used in a consciously dishonest way. That is, the person who uses them has his own private definition, but allows his hearer to think he means something quite different. Statements like _Marshal Pétain was a true patriot_. _The Soviet Press is the freest in the world_. _The Catholic Church is opposed to persecution_, are almost always made with the intent to deceive.

### Aberdein 1998: Persuasive Definition (response)

> It is not unreasonable to seek to employ a terminology with a tone as favourable as possible to the cause one wishes to advance. In some cases this may place sufficient tension on the sense of the words used as to border on PD. The adoption of the slogans 'Pro-Choice' and 'Pro-Life' by the two sides of the abortion debate has just such a character: it is unclear whether or not the sense of the terms 'choice' and 'life' has been unreasonably stretched.

Keith Burgess-Jackson advances that PD is frequently tied to the _vagueness_ of a term, where vagueness is "a simple tripartite division of the possible extension of the term into clearly applicable cases, clearly inapplicable cases and a penumbra of borderline cases." PD, to Burgess-Jackson, must changes the status of at least one case from clearly applicable to clearly inapplicable.

### Folk taxonomies

Bartlett, H. H. (1940). The concept of the genus: I. History of the generic concept in botany. Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club:

> The tendency to group plants into named genera, so generally characteristic of human thought and language, reflects the fact that there are not enough different words in the living, current vocabulary of any language to supply each closely similar plant with a basically distinctive name. We, for example, apply the name oak to many different trees, but so long as we stay in our own proper north-temperate habitat, our generic feeling for the oaks is true and consistent. As a matter of fact, Greene has shown that the generic idea “oak,” as held today, was really borrowed by scientific systematic botany from the folk science of the English pioneer settlers in temperate America, who extended the English folk concept of “oak” to cover the various widely different American oaks. In the eastern United States we distinguish white oak, burr oak, chestnut oak, live oak, scarlet oak, black oak, shingle oak and others, having a perfect binomial nomenclature for them in English, and, from the literary record, we may be sure that these designations owe nothing to scientific botany. They were in use in folk science before the botanists with their imperfect materials had anywhere nearly as good an idea of the oak species as the English colonists in the American woods.
