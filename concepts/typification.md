We go from parts to whole to parts; the parts tell us what type of whole; the type of whole fills in missing parts.

Patrick D. Farley:
> In rare cases, people who are born blind can have their sense of sight instated by surgery. But they don’t immediately start functioning as sighted individuals. They describe a confusing and utterly overwhelming in-pouring of colors and shapes, and it takes them months to learn how to mentally mark where objects begin and end and how perspective changes their apparent size and shape. Yes, they have to learn how to see “wooden desk by a window” instead of seeing the raw information of “brown here, and lighter brown here, and then bright grayish, but there’s still a similar brown below that, etc.” This is partialization. We reduce visual data to “materials.” Then we reduce materials to “objects.” Then we reduce collections of objects into “settings,” and we reduce the changes of objects into “movements.” And then we reduce patterns of movements and settings into “narratives.” And those narratives are what we think to ourselves and what we tell to other people.
