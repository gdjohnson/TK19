[[Jane Austen]], _Emma_:

> Emma: Ever since the day—about four years ago—that Miss Taylor and I met with him in Broadway Lane, when, because it began to drizzle, he darted away with so much gallantry, and borrowed two umbrellas for us from Farmer Mitchell's, I made up my mind on the subject. I planned the match from that hour; and when such success has blessed me in this instance, dear papa, you cannot think that I shall leave off match-making.
> 
> Mr Knightley: I do not understand what you mean by 'success. 'Success supposes endeavour. Your time has been properly and delicately spent, if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring about this marriage. A worthy employment for a young lady's mind! But if, which I rather imagine, your making the match, as you call it, means only your planning it, your saying to yourself one idle day, 'I think it would be a very good thing for Miss Taylor if Mr. Weston were to marry her,' and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards, why do you talk of success? Where is your merit? What are you proud of? You made a lucky guess; and _that_ is all that can be said.
>
> Emma: And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess?-I pity you.-I thought you cleverer-for, depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck. There is always some talent in it. And as to my poor word 'success,' which you quarrel with, I do not know that I am so entirely without any claim to it. **You have drawn two pretty pictures; but I think there may be a third-a something between the do-nothing and the do-all.** If I had not promoted Mr. Weston's visits here, and given many little encouragements, and smoothed many little matters, it might not have come to any thing after all. I think you must know Hartfield enough to comprehend that.

# Introduction

When we speak to the “complexity” of phenomena, we perhaps give some token nod to “emergence,” or the relation between parts. But we do _not_ so often discuss the real causes and implications of our operating inside high-entropy systems which refuse simplistic explanation. To some extent these implications are obvious, but insofar as they are obvious, they are implicitly ignored.

These systems are _multivariate_ and indeed almost infinitely variate, with a kind of “approached limit” of null effect as factors progress from most to least influence. Factors are not merely situated in a complex world (there is no such thing as “autonomy”); they are also constantly _in flux_ and _ambiguously bounded_. Identity is akin to a river: its edges and banks are constantly changing, swelling in rain and receding in summers; it is constantly dumping its contents into the mouth of the bay, and replenishing from the mountains; and somehow amidst this turmoil there is a thing we can call "the Mississippi."

It seems obviously a mistake then to appeal to reductionism—reductionism not in the naturalist, material sense, which is obviously if trivially true, but in the causal and dynamic sense of a system in progress. Very few systems we care about can be adequately explained by one or two variables, and yet this reductionism is constantly what we see; it may not be explicitly stated, but it is evidenced in the implicit _non-compatibilism_ of the scholarly outlook, an outlook no doubt motivated in large part by the natural incentives of the Bourdieusian [[fields]]: scarcities of recognition, scarcities of attention, scarcities of funding. We not only wish to distinguish ourselves in the sense of achievement; we wish for exclusivity, because exclusivity _is_ distinction. The achievement is merely what sets apart, or excludes; it is the vehicle, not the destination. Necessary but not sufficient, or not even necessary.

Similarly in the public domain we see an absolutism which refuses to cede any legitimacy to the positions of the other side: the moral standing of the fetus as human being must be flatly denied rather than simply subordinated to the rights of the childbearing woman. _Nature vs. nurture_ is flatly acknowledged by all as a false dichotomy, and yet it's rare to hear proponents of the nurture side acknowledge the influence of nature on demographic disparities. The difficulties, obstacles, or shortcomings of a given economic system are ignored or dismissed, rather than handled. Acknowledgment is avoided because it would oblige not just integration of the other's perspective but also a legitimation of the “other side,” requiring both bounding (compromise) and a ceding of right-to-speak. Neither is an acceptable outcome for an interested partisan. (Meanwhile the explanation for a phenomenon always lies, as if by coincidence, in the preferred causal structure of the observer's ideology.) 

And yet a generalized compatibilism appears to be the best course available toward apprehending or processing complexity, through recourse to a phenomenon's multidimensionality. We see this in our contemporary treatment of literary “interpretations.” Each reveals another dimension implicit in the work, and while any one interpretive dimension can be challenged, there is never an expectation of mutual exclusivity. Both/and vs. either/or.

Georgia Warnke, 1999, _Legitimate Differences_:

> We assume that these new dimensions of the work can appear because different interpreters approach it with different experiences and concerns, view it from within different contexts, and come at it from the vantage point of different interpretive traditions. We assume that we can learn from these interpretations and, indeed, that we can learn in a distinctive sense: not in the sense that we approach the one true or real meaning of the text or work of art but rather in the sense simply that we come to understand new dimensions of its meaning and thus to understand it in an expanded way.

I emphasize “contemporary treatment” because this attitude is not natural. It is the product of a century of discourse in literary theory, much of which began with warring over the “correct” interpretation of a text, then moved on to warring over the “proper” interpretive frame/s, and has finally settled on a pluralistic indeterminacy. In other words, it is _anticompatibilism_ and exclusivity of explanation which apparently constitute our ~~natural~~ positions on matters. (And here I strikethrough the term _natural_ in the way of Derrida, to show the simultaneous necessity and hopeless misfit of the word).

Of relevance here is Ken Liberman’s [observations of coffee-tasting], which builds off the work of Merleau-Ponty on “chiasmic intertwining.”

> When you drink the coffee, descriptors give you access to dimensions of the flavor and you can communicate those dimensions to other tasters... [you can] direct someone to find what can possibly be located with the use of that descriptor... _[it] is opening up the taste of the coffee but at the same time it's closing it down_, because once you categorize this basket of fruit... then how do you taste, you know, vanilla that's going on at the same time... Nobody's even attuning to it. You might not even sense it.

Our descriptions both unveil and veil simultaneously. In obscuring, we illuminate. To Merleau-Ponty, Heidegger, and many others, this is a central paradox of phenomenology. All perception is theory-laden: when we have perceived and carved the world one way, it becomes hard to see it another. (This is where [[defamiliarization]] steps in as artistic technique.)

Generalized compatibilism is a view of verbal, moral, and theoretical disputes alike. (See “[Linguistic Conquests]” for an explanation as to the reductionism of narrow-and-conquer methods in philosophy, which is mirrored in literary theory’s disputes over proper factoring of the handle “meaning.”) I take it as an extension of what is now commonly perceived as the most sophisticated understanding of the free will and determinism debate, known as _compatibilism_. In compatibilist frames, the free will and determinism debate has been hopelessly mired by linguistic confusions and conceptual differences. First there is the question of how we ground the "I," the individual assigned free will: is it in the conscious or unconscious mind? Then there is the question of what free will entails: is it merely the ability to select the most preferable option, given the circumstances, or does it necessitate some kind of physical autonomy from the machinations of the universe? Many compatibilists believe that the concept of freedom, in the typical sense of autonomy from other human beings, has been inappropriately applied, in a kind of category confusion, to the realm of physics. We could imagine an accurate description of the entire process of human action and decision-making which still lacked a satisfying answer to this dualism: why then spend so much time and effort on it, instead of toward understanding that full system?

The characteristics of this philosophical debate are shared by many ongoing debates across the humanities and [[inexact sciences]]: an appearance of irreconcilable difference which, when reconciled, present us with greater clarity than either position on its own.

# Sources of disagreement

The natural tendency toward _incompatibilism_, which I hope to identify and counteract here, is born, broadly, of _rhetorical_ (or "sociological") motivation, _discursive complexity_, and _linguistic confusion_. We will address each in turn. Our natural orientation towards weakmen ([2.1](#h-2.1)) is both a rhetorical and epistemic stance, characterized by conscious and unconscious maneuverings to win verbal disputes and maintain our status quo explanations of the world. Our tendency to present corrective partials ([2.2](#h-2.2)) as if they were our beliefs-in-a-vacuum seems to be a sociological effect, or else an epistemic quality of "interestingness" (the quality of an utterance worth uttering), where the worldview of our enveloping cultural context forms the implicit ground against which opinions are held and understood. Conceptual elephants ([2.4](#h-2.4)) are a result of map-territory confusion and the difficulty of linguistic and conceptual nebulosity. And rounding errors ([2.3](#h-2.3)) may be somewhere in between, emerging both from the difficulty of neutrally wielding language, as well as the tendency toward "weaponized abstraction" as rhetorical kill-shot. 

## Natural orientations towards weakmen

We will begin with perhaps the most obvious fact of public discourse. Most discourses, be they political or academic, tend to be mutually waged against weakmen—not so much the strawman, those erected pseudo-stances never held by opponents, but those weakest positions and over-extensions of each side. Toes are stomped on for their [[Extend-and-Retreat]] designs, and the worst folly, corroded by [[telephone effect]] is lit into, but the strongest version of an opponent is rarely dealt with. The why is fairly simple: to deal with the steelman is to in most cases be forced to alter one's one position, to incorporate some elements of the enemy, because intelligent, reasonable people do not hold tightly to fundamental beliefs which have no function or value. Thus the New Atheists might lambast Biblical literalism while avoiding its social benefits for coordination. The Science Wars are composed of critiques by philosophers against the softest of sciences (e.g. social psychology) as representing science as a whole; the dismissals by the pro-science camp, meanwhile, of continental critiques target their weakest stances, their silliest positions and absurdities, the most decadent excesses of social construction theories. All of this is by design: it allows each camp to remain in homeostasis under the pretense of having "acknowledged" and "dealt with" their challenging opponent, while not having in any way to change (because, of course, the critique is not substantial, it is so _weak_, what fools the otherside must be...)

## Corrective partials

[[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]], who having studied the effect of ideology on discourse ought to know better. Indeed, he writes of intellectual production:

> The logic of the operation of fields tends to make the different possibles that constitute the space of possibles at a given moment in time seem intrinsically, logically incompatible, when they are indeed incompatible, **but only from a sociological perspective**... The logic of the struggle and the division into opposing camps which differ with respect to the possibles that are objectively offered—to the point where each one sees or wishes to see only a fraction of the space—makes options that are logically compatible seem irreconcilable... Very often... **the social antagonisms underlying theoretical oppositions and the interests connected to these antagonisms form the only obstacle to getting beyond and to the synthesis**.

But, as [[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]] well acknowledges, it is difficult to see outside this space of possibles, and the framings of problems as presented by one's field. Thus [[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]] unwittingly reproduces the unwitting, ideological, and unnecessary dichotimizing of otherwise reconcilable frames: on one hand, the social ("nurture") explanation for disposition, on the other hand, the genetic ("nature") explanation. "[T]he dispositions linked to a certain social origin orient practice towards one or another of the 'possibles' offered as a function of the position which is occupied," he writes, and I am unaware, in his corpus, of an acknowledgment that much of one's disposition might be genetically inherited. Similarly, in _Sociology is a Martial Art_, we see him confidently asserting that all the personality differences between men and women must be the result of socialization. This assumptive, over-speculative, and unsupported reductionist view _is_ a kind of ideology in play, and perpetuates the anti-compatibilism that [[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]] himself recognizes as styming intellectual progress.

Perhaps this partiality is best witnessed in a decades-old radio interview with [[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]], in which he tacitly acknowledges the politicization of scholarship, whereby the points of the opposition must never be ceded even when (and especially when) true:

> Q: You didn't answer my question. Do [social hierarchies] serve a purpose?
>
> A: Well, that's a question that belongs to metaphysics. The sociologists doesn't have to take a stand. We know that there are areas... there is at least one... it's a small-scale society where differences hardly exist at all. It's an archaic society. And it works very well... But I'd rather put the question aside... I don't think we can answer it.
>
> Q: Because it's too complicated?
>
> A: Because it's complicated, and because I can't answer it.
>
> Q: Why is it so complicated? Can you explain it?
>
> A: Because there are important political issues at stake here... We're dealing with a political issue, and especially issues related to "legitimacy," the word I just used. There are people who would like to legitimize... There are those who say—roughly put, it's the dominant who say—that inequalities are justified. It's in their interest to say that inequality is a good thing. 

[[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]] calls this a "political" issue, not a sociological one, but asking the function or purpose of a social structure is clearly a valid sociological question, and it seems more precise to say that Boudieu is worried his answer could _become politicized_. That to cede hierarchy's benefits would be to enable an opposing political movement. Rather than acknowledge hierarchy's benefits, and then advocate a system which captures them while also avoiding hierarchy's costs, the benefits are merely denied, and any "solutions" advocated will be necessarily partial. Meanwhile, those who recognize the utility of hierarchy see a discourse which cannot admit basic truths to itself, which is utopian and revolutionary rather than measured and honest. 

A partial account is given; the [[justification]] for the partiality is that the account is a _corrective_ and an a political intervention, rather than a claim to holistic truth (even as it masquerades as truth, and denies other discourses their right to speak the complementary partial). 

A new generation of intellectuals comes of age arguing for hierarchy's utility, and not merely its oppressiveness, and the suppression of these truths by the previous intellectual regime only makes this new correction more compelling. Overstatement breeds overstatement; reduction reduction.

We can only understand this discursive landscape as a battlefield, as [[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]]'s "field," does, and Latour's "Why Has Critique Run Out Of Steam?" explores:

> Wars. So many wars. Wars outside and wars inside. Cultural wars, science wars, and wars against terrorism. Wars against poverty and wars against the poor. Wars against ignorance and wars out of ignorance. My question is simple: Should we be at war, too, we, the scholars, the intellectuals? Is it really our duty to add fresh ruins to fields of ruins? Is it really the task of the humanities to add deconstruction to destruction? More iconoclasm to iconoclasm?

## Rounding errors

Another obstacle is rounding errors and vagueness. As we get more concrete, two paradigms that appear irreconcilable may turn out to be meaningful but partial descriptions of some shared whole. Our precedent here is Hegel, whose dialectic method is for our purposes functionally equivalent to adding nuance in order to resolve apparent contradictions: the constituant, concrete parts do in fact align, as they must necessarily, if each of them describes workings of reality. 

The steelman of [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]'s obsession with physiological determinism is the idea that your personality and disposition have a strong effect on how you conceptualize or "round" the facts of the world: what you count as signal vs. noise, your expectations and anchors, your dispositional satisfaction or difficulty to please. Do we hold Plato accountable and emphasize his failures, or do we let him off for the context of his time and discourse, and emphasize instead his ability to break on occasion into brilliance? Or, The Socratic method is half right and half wrong, a classic glass of water problem. 

There is also always that age-old, three-blind-men-and-an-elephant problem: _you_ may claim Plato was a fraud, and _I_ might argue he was a saint of strong vision, but who is to say that we are discussing the same part of a large corpus of which neither of us has seen a comprehensive part? You might concede the game theoretic and sociological insight of _The Republic_, of the noble lie, but refuse to forgive his forms; I see the same failure in his forms but assign them less weight in my evaluation; they are an understandable shortcoming of his time, a sideshow to his ideas that really matter. We are differing in how to round up, how to assemble an evaluation of whole from parts. And it is entirely possible that we agree on almost every detail, and for reasons of disposition or worldview take entirely different stances on the quality of the whole. In no small part, either, are these roundings affected by the cadence of [[torque epistemology]]: whether we have been brought up, educationally, to treat Plato with great reverence, and are rebelling against an "overrated" figure—or whether our in-group sees ancient Greeks as antiquated, clumsy thinkers of little use, and are coming down in forceful opposition to perceived philistinism. The immediate "situation" of regard and opinion in our enveloping cultural context determines in large part our assessment: to say something is "great" is often, implicitly, to say it is "great _relative_ to the expectations of our interlocutor" (or vice-versa, with descriptors like "trash," "garbage," "worthless," etc.).

But there is also the problem of rhetorically, sociologically, and politically motivated abstraction, what I'll call "weaponized abstraction." In weaponized abstraction, an _instance_, event, or object is classified in the most damaging way possible. It may be a "technically" or "literally" accurate classification, but it arguably mischaracterizes the instance in _spirit_. To characterize MLK Jr. as a "criminal" is technically true—there is no contesting that he committed crimes, and was prosecuted and imprisoned for them—but the larger connotative and reputational baggages of criminality come from a very different set of typicals—petty thieves, burglarers, and murderers; men who exploit other men for self interest, _in addition to_ merely breaking the law. The classification is not "neutral," even if it looks it in a dictionary, because the class or category is composed of typicals, associations, and reputations which discredit the classified instance (MLK). Another recent example is Ocasio-Cortez's recent (2019) controversial labeling of immigrant detainee centers as "concentration camps." Natalie Wynn, aka "Counterpoints," has argued (in her treatment of "cancel culture") that weaponized abstraction underlies many tactics of the identitarian left, where more minor infractions are "upgraded" via technicalities to offenses like "sexual prediation," "sexual assault," or "racism"

## Conceptual analysis, conceptual elephants

James Russell 2003, "Core Affect and the Psychological Construction of Emotion":

> One of the mysteries of psychology is how it has been possible to define and construe emotion in such apparently incompatible ways, from biologically fixed modules similar to reflexes to attitudes to cognitive structures to socially constructed roles. If emotion were a well-defined natural kind with different theories of emotion competing head to head over the same territory, then scientific scrutiny should have rejected the false alternatives long ago. If, instead, the word emotion refers to a heterogeneous cluster of loosely related events, patterns, and dispositions, then these diverse theories might each concern a somewhat different subset of events or different aspects of those events. Theories about different things are not in competition, and empirical scrutiny can easily find evidence for each.

Defining words, and delimiting the boundaries of their extensions—or, alternately, carving up the world and assigning discrete chunks handles—is a difficult, subjective business highly contingent on function—the _telos_ of the carving, the instrumental purpose of a distinction or conflation. Frequently, scholars will battle over a carving _as if_ they were battling over the phenomenon. The concept's handle is reified and replaces the concept, and differences in _carvings_ and concept-assignation are mistaken for differences in theoretical and perceptual understandings of the world. (This is one of the classic map-territory confusions.)

Often, there are many _kinds_ of a phenomenon, and while claiming to describe the whole, a philosopher or social scientist will imagine a _typical_ of the superclass, and describe that typical _as_ typical. Simultaneously, another thinker will take a very different typical, due to personal experience or cultural exposure or preference etc, and take that as representative, and describe it. There will be the appearance of disagreement over the nature  of a phenomenon, but this disagreement is superficial, insofar as both are accurately describing different _sub_-phenomena of some superclass. (This was one issue in historical philosophy's attempts at conceptual analysis.)

The Meaning Wars in literary theory, which began with [[New Criticism]], ended with reader-response, and advanced, in real and significant ways, our understanding of the hermeneutic process between reader and text, were nonetheless mired by the elephant problem. Each camp argued that a text's true "meaning" lay in a different part of the reading and writing process—for intentionalists, in the author's [[intent]]; for reader-response theorists, in the interpretations of readers; in the formalists, in some objective meaning of the words. (This last, positivist theory, which saw meaning as somehow "contained" inside signifiers, separate from the cognitive understandings of their users, is today all but abandoned, as it now conflicts with everything we know about how language works.) Still today there is tension between the intentionalist and reader-response views, and a perceived incompatability: to intentionalists, there is a single, determinate authoritative "meaning" of texts, which resides in the author's self-interpretation; to reader-response theorists, "meaning" is indeterminate, changing across individuals, demographics, and time. But of course, neither side contests that there _is_ an author intent, or that reader interpretations vary and differ _from_ that intent; the general process of meaning-making and meaning-interpretation is agreed-upon, and much of what remains in conflict is lexicographic: the _meaning_ of "meaning." It is as if those blind men clutching the elephant's tail could be guided to, and feel, the elephant's trunk—but insisted that the true essence of an elephant was still its tail. Meanwhile, those holding its trunk take the opposite stance. Instead, we ought to think of meaning as a process of signification and interpretation, of entailment as designed by author and interpreted by reader, a holism encompassing many parts.

Tendencies toward what I'll term "linguistic conquests" exacerbate this issue. Linguistic conquests are scholarly maneuvers for taming nebulous, polysemous concepts into more tractable, stable definitions. There are two common approaches: _narrow-and-conquer_, and _divide-and-conquer_. The narrow-and-conquer approach is favored by aphoristic, hammer-and-nail types such as Nassim Nicholas Taleb. _Rationality_, Taleb tells us in _Incerto_, _is what survives. Period._ Compare now another contemporary thinker on rationality. _There are two types of rationality_, Yudkowsky tells us in the _Sequences_: _empirical rationality_—a Bayesian protocol for updating & maintaining the most accurate possible model of the world—_and instrumental rationality_—a protocol & set of beliefs that best help us achieve desired ends. Taleb is a better writer than Yudkowsky in many ways, but his tendency is toward reductive simplification, whereas Yudkowsky's is more toward equivocative reduction ("dissolving the question"), and here the difference counts. Through division, we now have to distinct sub-concepts, created through the qualifying adjective: whereas Taleb has narrowed the polysemous and nebulous "rationality" to "what survives," i.e. "what works," Yudkowsky has assigned this sense of rationality to _instrumental rationality_, and directly contrasted it to an empirical, Bayesian model-of-best-accuracy. Whereas it might be instrumentally rational (i.e. useful) to be religious, or believe in chaos magic (see also "hyperstition"), it would be empirically irrational. The difference comes from the belief—which we need here neither treat as true, nor contest, but only acknowledge—that there are contexts in which holding the most accurate model of the world is not the most useful.

When a number of narrow-and-conquer maneuvers have been performed over many generations of scholarship, we end up with "linguistic elephants"—situations in which scholars situated in different microcultures battle over definitions (features of the map) _as if_ they were battling over real-world phenomenon (features of the territory). In other words, different envisioned carvings and typicals are attached to handles in different microdiscourses; and because these discursive microcultures are subtle and often hidden from view, thinkers can appear to be engaged in a disagreement when in reality they are discussing true aspects of slightly or sometimes very different things.

Elliott Thornley, in "Knowing the difference can make all the difference" (2017) discusses how these language problems, and narrow-and-conquer approaches to language more generally, thwart clear understanding of the phenomena "optimism" and "pessimism." It's worth quoting at length (emphasis added), as a prime exhibit of how language clogs up the [[inexact sciences]], and how divide-and-conquer approaches can "therapeutically" resolve confusions:

> This kind of confusion about the benefits of optimism versus pessimism clouds a lot of our thinking. Newspapers and magazines ricochet between the two: one month optimism is the answer and there are [studies]  [to]  [prove]  [it], the next month pessimism is the answer and there are [studies]  [to]  [prove]  [it].
> _The Atlantic_ serves as a useful case study. Here’s a selection of headlines over the years: ‘Pessimism, The Key to Happiness?’ (June 2010), ‘A Pessimist Manifesto’ (September 2010), ‘How the Power of Positive Thinking Won Scientific Credibility’ (April 2012), ‘Why We’re Born Optimists, and Why that’s Good’ (December 2012), ‘The Benefits of Optimism Are Real’ (March 2013), ‘A Case for Pessimism’ (March 2013), ‘Why Do So Many People Hate Optimists?’ (December 2013), ‘The Secret to German Success: Pessimism?’ (April 2014), ‘The Upside of Pessimism’ (September 2014), ‘Optimism is the Enemy of Action’ (October 2014).
> 
> What’s going on? Why is it so difficult to decide which is best? Scientists have sent people to the goddamned moon. What’s causing all this confusion?
> 
> Shoddy thinking – that’s what – the kind of shoddy thinking that would have [[Socrates]] rubbing his hands in anticipation. What’s common to each and every one of these articles is that their authors have failed to think critically about what optimism is. These authors have read scientific studies and laboured to translate them into beautiful, readable prose. They’ve crafted anecdotes to draw the reader in. They’ve injected humour and emotion. But at no point during this long, arduous labour of love did they think to ask the most basic question: what is optimism?
> 
> Had they done so, they almost certainly would have consulted a dictionary. Had they gone to [e.g.]  [dictionary.com], they would have come across this:

> 1. _a disposition or tendency to look on the more favourable side of events or conditions and to expect the most favourable outcome._
> 
> Like Armstrong’s famous line, **this definition features a crucial, little ‘a’-word that’s easy to miss: _and_.** See it? Those bastards at [dictionary.com] have squeezed two definitions into one slot! The rascals at [Merriam-Webster] have done the same! And those good-for-nothings at [Cambridge]!
> 
> **The ‘and’ is crucial because there really are two definitions here. The first half says optimism is ‘a disposition or tendency to look on the more favourable side of events or conditions.’ The second half says optimism is ‘a disposition or tendency to expect the most favourable outcome.’** These are different things! It’s pretty clear that you could be an optimist in the first sense without being an optimist in the second sense and vice versa. Optimists in the first sense say ‘The glass is half-full’ and ‘Look on the bright side.’ They’re being optimistic about what’s _already _occurred. Optimists in the second sense say ‘Dream big’ and ‘Expect the best.’ They’re being optimistic about what _will_ occur. These are different kinds of optimism, so let’s draw a distinction. **Let’s call optimists in the first sense _interpretation-optimists_ and optimists in the second sense _expectation-optimists_. Then we can draw a corresponding distinction for pessimism: people who focus on the bad sides of things are _interpretation-pessimists_ and people who expect bad things to happen are _expectation-pessimists_.**
> 
> The failure to make these distinctions has infected almost all of our thinking about optimism and pessimism. I believe it's also contributed to the confusion surrounding which is the better attitude to have.

## Revolutionary mindsets

Paglia, in a 2003 CSPAN appearance, recounts of her time at Yale:

> There was a problem in American literary criticism: the [[New Criticism]] had gotten too formalist, too focused on the individual text apart from biography or historical context. It was a reaction against the bibliographic excesses of an earlier generation. What was needed was to supplement New Criticism, by bringing in historical context, history and psychology because New Criticism was also anti-Freud... What poststructuralists did was to abandon the whole thing. 

We ought to call this a revolutionary mindset: a preference for a revolving sequence of antitheses over a succession of interventions. The synthesis step is skipped in favor of perpetual instability and overcorrection of rudder. Incompatibilism: an exhausting see-saw, a zig-zag headed nowhere fast. Of course, to the revolutionary, the preference is rarely for the larger pattern of successive revolution; it is that _this particular_ revolution which he so absolutely supports must, logically, be absolutely implemented, which necessitates the destruction of the existing orthodoxy. Structuralism denies the freedom of man just as absolutely as its predecessor, existentialism, denied freedom's limits. Society must either be constituted top-down, unchangeable, or else bottom-up, unlimited—or so such reasoning goes; the reality is obviously cybernetic, where the norms and laws of a society shape individual actions just as individual actions shape norms and laws. But the French, it seems, are especially prone to these kinds of revolutionary absolutes; Latour writes in _The Enlightenment Without the Critique_:

> The French, it is well known, love revolutions, political, scientific or philosophical. There is nothing they like more than a radical upheaval of the past, an upheaval so complete that a new tabula rasa is levelled, on which a new history can be built. None of our Prime Nlinisters starts his mandate without promising to write on a new blank page or to furnish a complete change in values and even, for some, in life. Each researcher would think of him or herself as a failure, if he or she did not make such a complete change in the discipline that nothing will hereafter be the same. As to the philosophers they feed, from Descartes up to Foucault's days, on radical cuts, on 'coupure épistémologique', on complete subversion of everything which has been thought in the past bv everybody. No French thinker, indeed no student of philosophy, would seriously contemplate doing anything short of a complete revolution in theories. To hesitate, to respect the past, would be to compromise, to be a funk, or worse, to be eclectic like a vulgar Anglo-Saxon.

How can we be reasonable, how can we preserve the wisdom of the past even as we continue to hone and update it? We cannot, as Latour's scathing closing submits. We can look at the false dichotomy between Existentialism, with its unwielding Sartrean commitment to personal freedom in the face of all obstacles, and on the other hand Structuralism, with its "cultural dopes" or zombie-carriers of culture, who can merely enact the norms and rules of their society, as a false choice. Rather, the system is cybernetic, where bottom-up behavior affects top-down structure (as e.g. [[ethnomethodology]]'s "spontaneous organization" illuminates) but also a kind of "social reality" is internalized by actors which populates a narrow-ish space of default (or "automatic") possibile speech and action, which in many cases requires self-consciousness—in the Hegelian sense, as [[reflexivity]]—to break out of or overcome.

Similarly, it took [[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]]'s critique for social sciences to move past this "objectivist" vs. "subjectivist" false dichotomy, and yet in truth, the dichotomy should not have existed from the start. To [[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]], it is simply and obviously the case that "objective" or "physical" social structures exist in a world of institutions, relational networks, and class dynamics of material disparity—and also the case that these realities exist, simultaneously, in the cognitive schemas of actors who live within them, often in ways which distort, embellish, or cover-up the objective realities. Each feeds into the other: to reference Henrich's theories of [[status|prestige]] and social copying, there is an objective fact about cultural evolution and behavioral mimetics, who is copying who. There is a subjective fact about resource allocation, asymmetrical attention, and decisional deference that amount to the objective structures of "[[status|prestige]]." But there is also a subjective fact about admiration, desire, and the impression of prestige. The two are inseparable; each contributes to and shapes the other. [[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]] 1986, "Social Space and Symbolic Power":

> It is [what Goffman calls the] sense of one's place which, in interactions, leads people whom we call in French "les gens modestes," "common folks," to keep to their common place, and the others to "keep their distance," to "maintain their rank," and to "not get familiar." These strategies, it should be noted in passing, may be perfectly unconscious and take the form of what is called timidity or arrogance. In effect, social distances are inscribed in bodies or, more precisely, into the relation to the body, to language and to time—so many structural aspects of practice ignored by the subjectivist vision.

Of course, bound up in these disputes, be it over social genesis or textual meaning, are real disputes over emphasis, over which aspect is more important to study, over the exact factorings of the procedural dynamics. For instance, much of the _subjectivist-objectivist_ dichotomy in sociology was a dispute over the object and methodology of research, over whether to examine the "unconscious," material, and structural causes of behavior _separate from_ actors' psychological concepts, or whether to look only at actors behaviors and understandings (as in [[ethnomethodology]]). But the incompatibilist tendency prevents synthetic maneuvers. [[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]] 1986:

> The opposition is total: in the first instance, scientific knowledge can be obtained only by means of a break with primary representations—called "pre-notions" in Durkheim and "ideologies" in Marx‚ leading to unconscious causes. In the second instance, scientific knowledge is in continuity with common sense knowledge, since it is nothing but a "construct of constructs." [...]  [S]ocial science must take as its object both this reality and the perception of this reality, the perspectives, the points of view which, by virtue of their position in objective social space, agents have on this reality. The spontaneous visions of the social world, the "folk theories" ethnomethodologists talk about, or what I call "spontaneous sociology," but also scientific theories, sociology included, are part of social reality, and, like Marxist theory for instance, can acquire a truly real power of construction.

The very question of whether social structures exist in the real world or the human mind presumes the distinction; progress is made not by answering the question but by dissolving it.

# Towards compatibilism: steps forward

There are deep motivations to refusing to acknowledge an oppositional interpretation. But the most incisive—if not recognized—thinkers historically are those who manage to integrate their opposition into their own frame, who “yes and” or qualify, who can to “maintain coverage” or “preserve ground” rather than reduce multidimensional reality into one-dimensional explanations.

John Shook on John Dewey’s _fin-de-siècle_ philosophical practice:

> There were Hegelian rationalisms flourishing, other kinds of idealisms, various kinds of radical naive empiricisms, all kinds of anti-Darwinian alternatives. And Dewey [...] incorporated what they were trying to say into a naturalistic framework so thoroughly that nowadays the field looks very cleaned up from our perspective.

Perhaps the very first steps entail:

1. Reconciling background assumptions, to see on what account the difference might arise.
2. Interrogating which phenomena, specifically, are being described; that both positions use the same word or name to refer to their studied subject does not mean their subjects are the same.
3. Asking whether the distinction can be dissolved or re-carved; asking whether the distinction is important, and if so, toward what ends.

Miller's Law of Communication—that to understand someone's argument, you must first assume it to be true, then work out how—is one of the better shortcuts to compatibilist mindsets. The typical stance, once one has worked up an opinion on a matter, is to treat it at mutually exclusive with any contrasting stances; the instinct is to identify reasons the opposing view is wrong, which is often all too easily done. And yet this instinct ignores all that might be right, and perfectly agreeable, between the stances.

# Pragmatism as a compatibilist philosophy

_See entry on [[pragmatism]], particularly discussions of F. C. S. Schiller on metaphysics vs. naturalism, and [[William James]]'s reconciliation of rationalism and materialism._

# Commonplace

Vollmer 2013:

> Instead of using such categorizations to fight for academic turf, game-theoretical and microsciological insights may be combined to mutual benefit in the investigation of everyday interaction with respect to a variety of topics.

Philosophy's heterogeneity hypothesis: Traditionally, we understand there as being the separate, m/o/l competing "prototype theory," "exemplar theory," "theory theory," etc. However, as Machery (2009: Doing Without Concepts) and others have argued, there is good evidence from cognitive sciences and psychology that all of these "kinds" of concepts are equally employed in cognition, for different purposes and in different contexts. Therefore, we'll refer to them as subclasses in their own right.

## [[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]]: Sociology in Question

> Most of the time, the obstacle standing in the way of [synthesis] is not logical but sociological. Those who have identified themselves with Marx (or Weber) cannot take possession of what appears to them to be its negation without having the impression of negating themselves, renouncing their identity (it shouldn't be forgotten that for many people, to call themselves Marxist is nothing more than a profession of faith-or a totemic emblem). The same is true of the relations between 'theoreticians' and 'empiricists', between the sup-porters of what is called 'fundamental' research and what is called 'applied' research.
