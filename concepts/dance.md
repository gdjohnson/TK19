# Noë 2015: Strange Tools

Choreography is an art form, to Noë; dance, meanwhile, is an organized activity. Choreography "casts light on one of the ways we are organized":

> We are organized [neither at the level of the nervous system nor the level of conscious, deliberative action, but rather] at an intermediate level, at what the roboticist Dana Ballard has called the "embodiment level." ...the ability to dance is precisely an ability to let go, to let oneself be danced (as we might say)

But staged dance also takes on the larger world outside of itself: "To stage a dance is to put into view this organized activity within which we are, by nature, embedded but within which we are, as we tend to be, lost." To say that we are "dancers," as Noë does, is to say that we are all constantly improvising according to our habituated, dispositionally confirmed organization (see [[Habitus]] entry).

> Both philosophy and choreography take their start from the fact that we are organized but we are not the authors of our organization.
