JC Ransom, 1938:

> The first law to be prescribed to criticism, if we may assume such authority, is that it shall be objective, shall cite the nature of the object rather than its effects on the subject.

# Bourdieu 1986: Principles for a Sociology of Cultural Works

> A well-known initial division [in the literary [[fields|field]]] is that which opposes internl or formal readings (Saussure was wont to speak of "internal linguistics") and external readings, or, to use the words of Schelling and Cassirer, "tautegorical" as opposed to "allegorical" interpretations."

> New Criticism... has merely constituted an eplicit theory from the presuppositions of the "pure" reading of "pure" literature based on the absolutization of the text. The historically constituted presuppositions which are inherent to "pure" production—notably in the case of poetry—also find expression in the literary field itself, in England with the T.S. Eliot of _The Sacred Wood_ and in France with the _Nouvelle revue française_, and notably Paul Valéry.

Bourdieu contrasts two types of formalists readings: one, the "neo-Kantian tradition of symbolic forms," the other [[structuralism]], founded on Saussure's idea of the "primacy of relations" to understanding language:

> if one insists on giving a theoretical basis to this formalist tradition... one can move in two directions: on the one hand, the neo-Kantian tradition of symbolic forms or, more generally, all the traditions which seek to discover universal anthropological structures, such as Mircea Eliade's comparative mythology or Jungian or Bachelardian psychoanalysis, which academic hermeneutics easily borrow and eagerly combine; on the other hand, the structuralist tradition. 

> In the first case, through a tautegorical reading which relates works only to themselves, critics seek to rediscover the universal forms of poetic or literary reason, ahistorical structures which are at the basis of a poetic construction of the world. This position, perhaps because it is untenable, is hardly expressed as such, although it pervades all investigations of an "essence" of the poetic, of the symbol, of metaphor, and so on.

> The structuralist solution is intellectually and socially more powerful. Socially, it has taken over internalist doxa and bestowed a scientific aura to internal reading as a formal stripping, a dismantling of atemporal works. Breaking with neo-Kantian universalism, structuralist hermeneutics treats cultural works (language, myths, and by extension, works of art) as structured concepts without a structuring subject, which, like the Saussurean concept of _langue_, are particular historical realizations and must therefore be deciphered as such, but without any recourse to an external hermeneutics, that is, without reference to the social or economic conditions of the production of the work or the production of the producers of the work (such as the educational system).

## Paglia 1992: Sexual Personae's Cancelled Preface

> Western personality thus originates in the idea of mask. Society is the place of masks, a [[ritual]] theater. Persona's artistic origins were recovered by modernism and the [[New Criticism]], which stripped the text of biographical baggage. For the New Critics, a writer never speaks for himself but only through an assumed persona, a mask. Following World War Two, the classroom set piece was Jonathan Swift's _A Modest Proposal_, where a self-absorbed voice, airily proposing the cannibalistic farming of Irish infants, is the butt of the author's satire. [[knowingness|Irony]] and game-playing are central to this view of literature and life. The New Critical persona was indebted to Jung, who sees a split between our inner and ouer selves, an authentic psychic reality versus the mask conforming to social expectation. Popularized Jungianism, especially in its American feminist form, has become increasingly Rousseauist; that is, it tends to view society as automatically restrictve or oppresive instead of educative or civilizing.
