The Gricean maxims of conversation are essentially cooperative, consensual principles—they are the preferences that a reader carries for how a read agent ought to write. These include the maxims of quality (making a "true"—which we can interpret as pragmatically useful—contribution), of quantity (efficient communication), of relevance, and of manner (avoid ambiguity and obscurity, being orderly). These can be boiled down more to a general desire that information update reader behavior in a way which will most benefit the reader: by altering his model (and by extension his actions) only in the direction of better calibration, in areas which are relevant to his life, and doing so in the most efficient way.

When the reader assumes the writer is writing in such a way (that is, cooperatively and considerately), he can also effectively read for sub-textual implicature.
