A society becomes decadent; its pragmatism converts into hedonism, less in its orgiastic term and more in its submission to social games, the cult of self, identitarian desire and spiritual entitlement .

How does desire lead to [[hierarchy]]? Those who are desired, or provided what is desired, gain [[status]] in the [[status|prestige economy]]. They are then emulated by those who have less [[status]], and the process of emulation transmits desire, in the Girardian sense; in other words, desire and hierarchy are caught in a cybernetic loop.

# VGR 2020: Twitter thread

> Most of the time [[ambiguity]] in goal-setting is not about wanting the wrong thing or being confused about means-ends matches. It is about wanting the thing wrong. You want to want the thing-itself. The naked, nominal, stated goal, not psychologically adjacent bullshit.

> Half of experience is recognizing when you want the thing versus when you want the thing only because you unconsciously want something else that’s a potential side effect you don’t want to cop to.

> The inefficiency of unacknowledged goals cannot be six-sigmaed away. If you’re working out to look good or for endorphin rush, but pretending to work out for strength/health (even to yourself) the dissonance will make you ineffective at both.

Some parallels here to Lacan's _objet petit a_, which Zizek compares to Hitchcokc's MacGuffin: the thing is not the point; the point is moving the plot along, which the thing does. 

[[Signaling theory]], coupled with Trivers on self-deception, gets us somewhat more mileage: if we have a "thing we believe we desire," A, which is apparent, and "thing we actually desire," B, which is hidden, B usually relates to A by beyond _beyond_ it, by being a second-order social effect to the first-order A. This second-order social effect is typically about being better regarded or more desirable (as an ally, as a sexual partner). To Trivers, it is a _feature_ not to realize one's real target is B, since this hiding from self allows us to better hide the true goal from others. Thus we look down on those who write explicitly for the identity markers or the praise, on those who lift or travel to sunny beaches explicitly for the "vanity" of a better body. In common parlance, such people are "in it [e.g. writing, wine-making, etc] for the wrong reasons"—even as, paradoxically, these people most know their true motivations, and are in it for the "same" reasons are their more deluded colleagues. We might see parallels in the way tit-for-tat reciprocity is hidden in gift-giving practices.

# Pfaller: On the Organization of the Libido in Belief and Faith

> Object-libido can be transformed into ego-libido (and vice-versa). In the transformation of object-libidio into ego-libido, however, the manner in which pleasure is experienced is transformed. To put it into plainer terms, we could say that _joy turns into self-esteem_. Every ascetic foregoes food, sexual satisfaction, comfortable society, and so on, but doing so gains a considerable amount of respect for his or her own self.

(_Note: this is a good illustration of the general principle that the human power of conceptualization, or "framing," has an enormous effect on how one experiences the world, down to deeply visceral levels of pain and pleasure._)

# Curtis: The Century of the Self

Paul Meiser of Lehman Brothers: "We must shift America from a needs to a desires culture... man's desires must overshadow his needs."

In Curtis's telling, American working and middle-class culture shifts from a pragmatic orientation to consumption, to an identity-based orientation: to become a type of person, to embody a certain spirit, to feel a certain way (due to feeling like a person...). Edward Bernays, the American nephew of Freud and the inventor of the "public relations concept," helped spearhead this change, with his propagandistic work for the US gov during WWI, and then his successful "torches of freedom" cigarette campaign, to end the stigma of women smoking. (Well-placed debutantes, inhaling on-camera.)

Mrs Stillman, celebrity aviator in the 1920s, for an ad: "I'm sure all of you are interesting and have wonderful things about you but looking at you in the street you all look so much the same... Try and express yourself better, _in_ your dress. Bring out certain things that you think are hidden."

# Luke Muehlhauser: Not for the Sake of Pleasure Alone 

Wanting and liking, or desire and pleasure, seem to be hooked up to different neural pathways and do not necessarily co-occur, as evidenced in studies of facial expressions and physical reactions in humans and mice. Dopamine appears to be a key part—perhaps even a cause—of desiring. However, patients with damaged dopamine receptors maintain the ability to experience gustatory pleasure. High dopamine levels, further, are linked to strong felt desire.

# Richard Alexander interview

> There are still very sophisticated philosophers who can't grasp that when you speak of the interests of organisms, such as humans, you are not merely talking about their conscious interests, you are talking about all their interests, whether they are conscious or deliberate or not.
