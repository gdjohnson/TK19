# Sytsma & Livengood: The Theory and Practice of Experimental Philosophy

> the image most often associated with [experimental philosophy] is the burning armchair

Descartes' _Meditations_ is the "quintessential example" of philosophy as pure thought, where D. shuts himself away for days to be alone with his thoughts in an attempt to "demolish" the foundations of his opinions.

Still, experimental philosophy is nothing new; Sytsma & Livengood call the current movement "the new experimental philosophy"; Descartes, for instance, dissected Ox eyes and was an active scientist. It is only recently that philosophy has become disconnected from this legacy.

> The image of the burning armchair no doubt served a sociological purposeâ€”it drew a sharp line in the sand, polarized positions, and worked up fervor... this likely contributed to the rapid growth of the new experimental philosophy over the past ten years. But such divisive rhetoric can also create problems.
