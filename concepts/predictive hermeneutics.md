"When you use a word that’s true and unexpected, it’s poetry. When you tell a story that’s true and unexpected, it’s literature." (fr. an anonymous blogpost on information theory and writing)

# The predictive frame

Truth, [[William James]] holds, is “a species of the good,” like health. Truths are goods because we can “ride” on them into the future without being unpleasantly surprised.

Intelligence, meanwhile, is the ability to optimize for the future according to an organism's preferences, to model complex phenomena and anticipate how different actions by the organism will lead to different states. It is the ability to steer the ship toward a narrow port of safety, away from rocky coasts, stormy waters.

We live in an age of anxiety, and anxiety is a predictive disorder, all frayed anticipation. One is tempted to wonder how much of contemporary anxiety could be better understood as wiping out in uncertainty, rather than surfing it.

# Wait, what? Sense-making and sense-breaking in modern art

In [a recent paper](https://gdjohnson.github.io/docs/Predictive%20Hermeneutics.pdf), my collaborator Tom Rutten and I advanced a tentative theory of how contemporary visual artworks might interact with a predictive error minimization (or “[predictive processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_coding)“) system in human viewers. The [[predictive processing]] model of cognition is a relatively recent figuration of the age-old problem of [inference](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/induction-problem/) (how humans make predictions from patterns and pull patterns from data), originating in the work of computational neuroscientists like Friston, Rao, and Ballard in the 1990s but prefigured by Jeurgen Schmidhuber, whose theory of cognitive “compression” has been covered previously [on this site](https://carcinisation.com/2014/07/15/what-is-intelligence/) and its [neighbors](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2015/04/22/a-better-art-vocabulary-part-1/).

I haven’t yet tried summarizing the paper’s ideas in an informal way, or arguing ([beyond Twitter](https://twitter.com/suspendedreason/status/1221602332762345473)) for its usefulness as a theory. Here, I advance that argument both modestly and boldly.

As a brief overview, predictive error minimization is the hypothesis that our brains make hierarchical, top-down predictions about the sensory experiences it encounters; bottom-up information is propagated up the hierarchy as error signals, correcting and updating the top-down high-level hypotheses. It’s compelling in part because it explains so many otherwise-wooey research findings about how expectations and beliefs (themselves formed through previous experiences) actively shape our running experience of reality, from the effect of price on perceived quality to the distortions of post-traumatic stress disorder.

The modest version of our argument is this: If we take the [[predictive processing]] model as our most-accurate-yet description of how cognition works, we gain insight into how a piece of art or literary text (for example) interacts with our sensory and analytical systems. We gain a vocabulary for talking about what a “schema,” or cognitive knowledge structure, is, and what it means for that structure to learn from surprising events and prediction errors, and how expectations and beliefs at the structure’s highest level can radically distort how sensory experiences are processed at its lowest. We can begin talking about how different types, or periods, of art might enact themselves on, or manipulate, the schema differently, and how divergences between individuals’ schemas (their “calibrations”) can lead them to receive an artwork divergently in turn. While the basics of the art-mind interaction have already been sketched out in various aesthetic and hermeneutic theories, predictive hierarchical cognition 1) fills in missing theoretical gaps and 2) acts as secondary evidence for some of these theories while rejecting others. The paper’s further suggestion is that a key feature of 20th and 21st century artworks lies in their intent to the _subvert_ their viewers’ schemas: they aim to propagate sensory and conceptual errors up the hierarchy, revising viewers’ high level priors about art or the world. This is not dissimilar from the hypothesized function of jokes by [Dennet & Hurley et al](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2015/06/04/puzzle-theory/).

To present our argument boldly: The steelman of the modernist and avant-garde project is basically “Art = a technology that activates, subverts, and bares our predictive schema” (i.e. the perceptual filter through which we understand the world). Unfortunately, right now the public factoring of that project is still relatively muddled and confused; there’s a real sense from many artists that they aren’t sure what they’re “supposed to be” doing, and from critics that the justificatory ground beneath their taste is perpetually receding. “Schematic subversion”—the subversion of viewers’ (cognitive) structure of expectations—offers both a coherent description of the gestalt 20th century art project as well as point to a path for honing art within that tradition—as a technology or instrument toward a coherent end with demonstrable human benefits.

We argue first that literary and artistic encounters can, and ought to be, conceptualized as designed temporal experiences which continually update, anticipate, and act either synchronously with or against the reader/viewer’s structure of expectations. Over the course of reading a book, our impression of a character, or his circumstance, or the direction of the plot (for instance) is constantly mutating as we take in new information. In literary theory, this is known as the hermeneutic circle; our understanding of a part informs our understanding of the whole which in turn informs our understanding of a part:

![[hermeneuticCycle.png]]

As a toy demonstration of how this temporal process of updating and revision works, we can use a garden-path sentence like “The old man the boats.” On first parse, one assumes “old” is an adjective modifying the noun “man”; when that interpretation “breaks” on us, we switch to parsing “old” as a plural noun and “man” as in its verb form. In our first parse, the high probabilistic likelihood of “the old man” signifying an elderly male may have made our initial interpretation so strong that the subsequent “the boats” cannot immediately amend it, and a second or third reading is required to verify that the dramatically unlikely minority sense-meaning is, in fact, the one intended.

In the case of post-1900 work, actively subverting audience expectation (somewhat like a garden-path sentence) replaces synchronicity as a dominant aim. This new, post-1900 kind of artwork should be understood as a technology analogous to psychedelics (see [Friston’s work with Carhart-Harris](http://pharmrev.aspetjournals.org/content/pharmrev/71/3/316.full.pdf) on REBUS): designed to massage users’ hierarchical predictive structures, either to interrogate deep-rooted assumptions or else nudge them into a new “potentialities,” new perceptions or orientations toward reality. We divide the subverted expectations into two types: those set up by the outside world (e.g. the expectations one walks into an art encounter with, based on genre, or artist reputation, etc), and those created by the work itself (e.g. casting a character as initially malevolent, who is eventually revealed to be of strong moral character).

These new, post-1900 works are machines which create for participants temporal experiences characterized by a morphing set of expectations, beliefs, and predictions. The negotiation between participant and artwork generates the experience of “interestingness”—an enjoyable, dynamic interplay. The work “is not the work”; instead, processing and interpreting the work is what produces “the work.” This active interpretive process replaces traditional plot as the work’s underlying temporal logic & dynamic—the almond milk of narrative.

## Schema-subverting art

1956 interview of Marcel Duchamp, by James Johnson Sweeney, for the Philadelphia Museum of Art:

> Dada has been described by Duchamp as a complete disavowal and denial of established interpretive approaches.

The conceptual carving we call “schema-subverting art” in our paper tries to be meaningful by describing a fundamental, intrinsic value of the 20th century art project which is distinct from previous age’s aesthetic value hierarchies. It therefore inevitably doubles as a theory of the 20th century’s art project, a project which must be (1) coherent across many schools & movements and yet (2) distinct from the pre-modern paradigm. “Schema-revising” or “schema-subverting” art drives a through-line from the likes of, at the 20th century’s start, Cubist painting, rip-it-up Dada, and modernism’s relentless “make it new”—through to the happenings, psychedelia, and conceptual anti-art of the century’s center—to finally, the justice-oriented and activist work of contemporary avant production. All of these periods—though distinct in their attitudes toward materiality, politics, technique, and representation—are united in their preoccupation with perception, disruption, and disrupting perception: in a phrase, schematic interrogation.

Artistic production and theory in the 20th century shifts its emphasis from the material to the experiental. Art begins to be understood, or conceptualized, as an emergent product of the interaction between participant and stimulus. (Soon after, in a reflection of the zeitgeist, structuralist hermeneutics begins moving into theories of “reader response”: that the meaning of a text is an emergent property of its interaction with the interpretive schema of its reader, instead of an intrinsic property of the text itself.)

John Dewey is an unsung figure in this sea change in visual art. [Allan Kaprow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Kaprow), who started the participatory, multi-media Happenings movement in the 1960s treated Dewey’s _Art As Experience _like a Bible. Dewey was friends with Matisse and MoMA director Alfred Barr; his thinking touched John Cage and Fluxus, Rob Rauschenberg, Claes Oldenburg, Ray Johnson of Correspondence Art, and the [Black Mountain College](http://www.blackmountaincollege.org/history/) curriculum. Dewey’s ideas “reoriented” Bauhaus; [Josef Albers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Albers) befriends him and suddenly starts speaking like him: “We do not always create ‘works of art,’ but rather experiments; it is not an ambition to fill museums: we are gathering experience.” Or: “Through  some kind of art experience… the student can come into realization of order in the world.” Dewey’s foil in the era is the better-read [Clement Greenberg](http://www.yorku.ca/yamlau/readings/greenberg_modernistPainting.pdf): a cult of flatness and an obsession with material. One philosophy wins. 

So art is an experience. It has a temporal dimension. It emerges from participant—reader, viewer, listener—meeting work-as-crafted-stimulus. From [[predictive processing]] it follows that it emerges from the interaction between work and the participant’s predictive schema. This is a thing art does, can do. When you boil away differences in the specific ways 20th century movements and schools have talked about such things—“make it new,” Russian [defamiliarization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamiliarization), _art that challenges us, art that changes how we see, art that lets us imagine alternate possibilities—_you’re left with this shared phenomenon of subversion and revision, and there’s a reasonable way we can imagine that this art really does flash us with self-awareness of our perceptual structures (what we call an “effect idea” in the paper), and really can update our understanding of the world, possibly in extra-linguistic, underlying ways less accessible to non-fiction. This is the ideal: to find a niche, or purpose, which no other technology can comparably achieve. Visual art’s crisis, in part, comes from being outcompeted (by film, recorded music, and even the printing press) on many fronts it once excelled at.

### More on schema-subverting art

Of course, there are more and less interesting kinds of subversion. Many have disparaged the kind of Socratic, pseudo-ontological anti-art, whose questions—in the light of what we know about the messy, fluid nature of categories, and the instability of meaning. Any child can smash a structure; few can assemble one; few adults can assemble one worth protection from smash.

As surprisal and subversion in art has moved from the visual-physical to conceptual domains, the eye has become "incapable of breaking into the intellectual system that today distinguishes between objects that are art and those that are not." (Ed Halter, the Centaur and the Hummingbird)

*Childish & Thomson 2000: "Anti-Anti-Art"*

> The art of Marcel Duchamp is not art. It is anti-art by intent and effect. To justify anti-art there must be the existence of art... Today's art is anti-art. The principle of anti-art is meaningless in the absence of art to be anti.

## Further directions

Lastly, some terms from aesthetic and literary theory that make more sense in the light of predictive processing:

* [Resonance](https://suspendedreason.com/2018/08/06/resonance/): As Dominic Fox has pointed out [over at Poetix](http://www.codepoetics.com/blog/2017/03/20/identity-poetics/), resonance is a kind of “fit” or accord between the worldview tacitly contained in an artwork, and the worldview of the engaging participant.

> In an art encounter, our mind updates its inferential models about the world with respect to the work’s perceived accuracy, an assessment made by the model itself. The observer’s schema acts as a “check” or arbitrator on its own incorporation of the artworks’ worldview (dynamics and concepts); when the cartography of the work is too implausible in the eyes of an apprehending schema, it may be dismissed entirely. This is to say that concepts learned directly from personal experience, and indirectly from outside sources, are used to assess the likelihood of a work’s worldview as conveyed through its components. The artwork’s “truthiness” as estimated by the viewer can be understood as its precision, or reliability (Clark 2016). In this way the schema can be understood as a gatekeeper to its own revision: only stimulus surpassing some level of intelligibility and precision for a viewer will be able to interact with the viewer’s schema and incite revision. One consequence is that information which fits closely with an existing schema but poorly with a ground-truth reality is perceived by that schema as more, rather than less, likely to be the case.

* Ambiguity: A situation in which there is no dominant, top-down hypothesis about what is being perceived or communicated. All communications and artworks have [[ambiguity]], but certain works or modes of communication use that ambiguity intentionally to bring about an effect. Works become more ambiguous over time as the inherent, local, “[indexical](https://carcinisation.com/2020/01/27/ignorance-a-skilled-practice/)” context in which they are embedded is lost, or overwritten. This makes them effectively “lost” to us; the experience of encountering them as they were intended to be encountered is no longer possible, and they are often defanged as a result.
* Defamiliarization. I’ll quote our paper at length here, because I believe it’s the best explanation I can put forward.

> A well-known phenomenon in psychology is the cessation of full awareness of familiar stimuli. The phenomenon has been called “compiling” by Herbert A. Simon, “tacit dimensionality” by philosopher Michael Polanyi, the “ready-to-hand” by Martin Heidegger, and “driving on autopilot” in casual parlance (Ekman 2013). In the terms of the Russian Formalist school [of aesthetics], it is the difference between recognition and seeing, where to recognize is to perceive in a minimal, peripheral way. Under the PEM framework, we can understand this as schemas “explaining away” well-integrated stimuli. Where high-novelty information, or significant clashes between our expectations and sense data, earns more awareness in this model, low novelty or schema-congruent sensory data is allocated less space in the consciousness field.

> To the Formalists, a crucial aim of art was defamiliarization, where the everyday and banal (or “ready-to-hand,” or “pre-compiled”) is presented in a way which distorts it into newness. Audiences appreciate a fresh sight of what was previously merely recognized. Often, the defamiliarized subject is not immediately recognizable for what it is; only when the mind connects the defamiliarly presented with the familiarly known, an analogic link is created between the two which upcycles into new models, or interpretations, of the familiar.

> An adjacent concept to defamiliarization, taken from psychology, is cognitive disfluency, which describes effortful attention to a stimulus (in contrast to automatic or effortless attention). Disfluent experiences, such as the art encounter, have been found to “improve syllogistic reasoning and reduce reliance on heuristics” (Hurley, Dennett, and Adams 2011). Tellingly, both awkward situations and avant artistic encounters are characterised by the disruption of automaticity in favor of more disfluent hermeneutic or affective states.

## The role of expectation in art experiences

Taekwan Kim, in "What Is 'Degenerate'?" (2014):

> If the above analysis is true, we have to accept the strong likelihood that anticipating the social discussion or cultural evaluation around a game is actually an integral part of its design

Similarly, we may turn on a work of art, which in a vaccuum we would have objectively admired and enjoyed, because it is "overrated," because we are reacting to the discourse around it [[torque epistemology]]-style.

### Delany: The Jewel-Hinged Jaw

> The story is what happens in the reader’s mind as his eyes move from the first word to the second, the second to the third, and so on to the end of the tale.

> A sixty-thousand word novel is one picture corrected fifty-nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine times.

> When the corrections as we move from word to word produce a muddy picture, when unclear bits of information do not resolve to even greater clarity as we progress, we call the writer a poor stylist.

### Delany 1995: “Some Remarks on Narrative and Technology”

> Whether fulfilled or violated, each expectation citable in a narrative is the sign of a relationship between what comes before it and what comes after it. Not all of these relationships are necessarily consecutive, nor do they all run only from the past to the future. Something happen­ing on page ten of a text may charge or recharge with meaning some­thing we read on page two. And this can happen at any level. In short, we do not know the critical status of every narrative relation. Often these re­lations are pleasurable simply in themselves. But what we are doing here is recomplicating narrative itself into a poetic model.

# Genericism and domesticity

Related to accessibility is the concept of domesticity as defined by Thurston (2018). When a reader’s schemata  can easily provide high-probability explanations of a  textual work and interfaces with many concepts, C, familiar and highly networked in the mind of reader, there will be a high proportion of spreading activation, the process by which textual materials contact and interface with associated concepts within the reader’s mind. We can call such works “domestic” for their high relevance and comfortableness to an observer.

When the information and concepts necessary to access a work are common to large swathes of the population (or when a work’s thematic concepts can be considered widely domestic), we can call this work both highly accessible and highly generic.

# Nick Lowe on narrative

Lowe theorizes narrative as an "epistemological experience" of a reader continually updating his interpretation. 

# The bigger picture: subversion, interrogation, modeling

Conrad, "Dolomite: Having No Trust in Readers":

> I want art to stand strong, to display how it manipulates its audience. I want it to take up their expectations, their sense of the world, their predispositions toward the way they think or use their language, and then to use these things perversely, politically, colorfully, "expressively."

Sontag, [[The Aesthetics of Silence]] refers to modern art's "chronic habit of displeasing, provoking, or frustrating its audience."

## Malick's moments of breakage

Malick is a student of Heidegger, and the connections between his work and the philosopher's are well-documented. Tom van der Linden discusses how in many of Malick's films, the turning point comes when the character encounters a "breakage" with their previously pragmatic, automatic, and sociologically "organized" behavior. The world is transformed from ready-to-hand to present-at-hand. This reckoning with the "why" of being, as van der Linden puts it—and the portrayals of those who refuse to continue automatically, as in _A Hidden Life_—form the drama of Malick's cinema. From the everyday, the characters are pushed into larger questions of purpose and telos, forced to examine the effects and consequences of the systems they participate in, or the lifestyles they live; they are forced out of intuitive, unthinking organization and into a thinking through of that organization.

## Noë 2015: Strange Tools

### The effect of art on perception and situated understanding

> Art, really, is an engagement with the ways our practices, techniques, and technologies organize us, and it is, finally, a way to understand our organization and, inevitably, to reorganize ourselves.

In this way it is a practice akin to [[defamiliarization]]: by breaking us out of the unconscious ready-to-hand, from recognition into sight proper, we get a chance to remake our organized structures. (_See entry [[Innovation vs Imitation]] for full discussion_)

> just as writing shapes our conception of language, as I argued in the last chapter, so pictures shape our conception of seeing. And just as writing loops down and alters our live action in and with language, so pictures loop down and alter the ways we exercise our visual powers.

### Art as interrogation

To Noë, choreography is an art form that interrogates how we are organized, how we dance; dance, meanwhile, is an organized activity. Visual artists "are putting picture making itself, or vision itself, in the frame for inspection"; poetry and fiction is "in the business of writing us, or writing us again or anew." All "art" in this frame is interrogative, is "second-level," to the lower layer of organized reality. 

[[Peli Grietzer]], _Amerikkkka_:

> People sometimes observe that David Bowie’s personae drew attention to their own constructedness, and that’s right in a sense. But really what Bowie’s personae did was draw attention to their operational assumptions.... [each] was the crisis of thinking its way out of its operational assumption. 

### Cartography & modeling

*On art as producing models:*

> the existene of choreographies—their image, their power to coalesce and stand forth as models of how the activity could or should be done—loops back down and shapes how we think about dancing, and thus how we dance, even when we are by ourselves or in our most intimate settings.

> We are familiar with architect’s models (in balsa wood, say), model airplanes (in plastic), fashion models, and model apartments, not to mention scientific models and animal models in the biosciences. What all these have in common is that they are things we put to work in order to think about or investigate something else... the balsa wood house is very useful in showing, say, the scale of the house and its various proportions. But it conveys nothing about materials and very little about landscaping and the like. The crucial point is that models are ways of exploring the world or accomplishing certain goals.

*On art as cartography:*

> Consider, first, that although art and philosophy are practices of investigation of the ways we find ourselves habitually organized, it is crucial that these second-order activities _arise out of_ the first level [of organized practice]. Art is like mapmaking, in this respect. And crucially, people don't make maps just for the heck of it; no, they make maps because they get lost without them. The task of generating a representation of the lay of the land has its source in a real need, or a felt anxiety.

> Maps are models, and we select maps at different scales depending on what we’re trying to do... a critical feature of models, whether in science or in tabletop conversations, is that they achieve their work only against the background of shared context. 

# Sandbox Theory

*Murphy Paul 2012: Your Brain on Fiction*

> Researchers have also discovered that words describing motion also stimulate regions of the brain distinct from language-processing areas. In a study, led by the cognitive scientist Veronique Boulenger, of the Laboratory of Language Dynamics in France, the brains of participants were scanned as they read sentences like "John grasped the object" and "Pablo kicked the ball." The scans revealed activity in the motor cortex, which coordinates the body's movements. What's more, this activity was concentrated in one part of the motor cortex when the movement described was arm-related and in another part when the movement concerned the leg.

*Oatley 2010*

> [Fiction] is a particularly useful simulation because negotiating the social world effectively is extremely tricky, requiring us to weigh up myriad interacting instances of cause and effect. Just as computer simulations can help us get to grips with complex problems such as flying a plane or forecasting the weather, so novels, stories and dramas can help us understand the complexities of social life.

## fr Predictive Hermeneutics: on interpretation

### Markers of priority

Insofar as an observer sees a work of art as a form of communication, attentional prioritization will take place on somewhat the same grounds as, or with some degree of symmetry to, what the director intends the viewer to prioritize (since the essence of communication is the ongoing attempt to understand what the interlocutor means to convey through an utterance, and not merely what is, technically, said). **Audiences search for markers of hierarchical importance in a communication**, while artists employ intuitive or else culturally established motifs of emphasis to signal [[intent|intentionality]] to observers. Insofar as the artist knows element *m* of the artwork is a marker, the audience knows *m* is a marker, and the director knows the audience knows *m* is a marker (these being the conditions for mutual knowledge), communication is possible. Foregrounding an object, action, or utterance is one default mode in film and visual art to communicate priority, e.g. through volume, prominence, tonal stress differentiation, size, position, or lens focus. Not only are foregrounded events more likely to be naturally noticed, they also direct attention and inform high-level conceptions of communicative priority.

### **Syntax & punctuation as non-meaning-bearing signals of intent**

At the sentence level, commas and syntax are two examples of textual markers which enable greater hermeneutic accuracy by signaling intentionality—that is, the specific way the words are intended to be interpreted, or the “continuity of senses” postulated by de Beaugrande. When the meaning of a sentence remains unclear, perhaps due to ambiguous reference or grammatical structure, the interpreter must formulate a guess based on one, dynamics and structure from the real world, and two, assessments of the speaker and his motives. Predictive systems of inference allow us to accurately gauge the [[intent]] in the ambiguous sentence *She announced a program to promote safety in trucks and vans* (an example taken from natural language processing). Is the announcement made “in [read: *inside*] trucks and vans”? Did the speaker announce the program *in order* to promote automobile safety, or is it the program which promotes automobile safety?

### **Retroactive updating**

In garden-path sentences, such as “The old man the boats,” the initial assumptions of a first parse— that “old” is an adjective modifying the noun “man”—must be updated to identify “old” as a plural noun and “man” as in its verb form. In the initial parse, the high probabilistic likelihood of “the old man” signifying an elderly male makes that initial interpretation so strong that the subsequent “the boats” cannot immediately amend it, and a second or third reading is required to verify that the dramatically unlikely minority sense-meaning is, in fact, the one intended.

Finally, at the level of individual word senses, we can theorize a subject who is aware of an approximate probability distribution consisting of the discrete likelihood of each individual sense-meaning—connotative, denotative, rhetorical, and figurative—of a given utterance within its context. Moreover, this probability distribution is known, varyingly and approximately, among the larger population of native speakers. Finally, the distribution, similar to textual markers of priority, is mutually known—that is, all members of the group are aware that other members of the group will have similar hypotheses about utterances, this being the step that enables predictable communication, and thus allows us to communicate at all. Language, as we’ve analyzed it so far in §2.3, can be understood loosely, alluding not just to natural languages but also the languages of cinema, visual symbolism, musical moods or motifs, and so on.

### **Indirect speech & poetry**

At the phrasal level, predictions are made, for example, as to whether an act of indirect speech (e.g. the veiled threat It would be a shame if something happened to…) is meant literally or more suggestively (Pinker, Nowak, and Lee 2008), and both interlocutors in the exchange must share similar-enough models of the phrase’s rhetorical probabilistic likelihood within the threatened party’s linguistic schemas to communicate. Poetry, as we will see, is engaged, among other things, is undermining and “riffing on” the dominant and thus expected sense-meanings of its language, requiring the poet to have a well-tuned linguistic “metaschema”—a predictive model of readers’ predictive models. Similarly, speakers and writers engaged in rhetorical or informative communication must acquire intimate knowledge of how their words and grammars will be parsed by their respective audiences, allowing them to sidestep ambiguities or miscues to get across what they “really” mean to say.
