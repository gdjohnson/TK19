Jeffrey Gray views intentionality as the organizing principle of the contents of consciousness; it is the logic behind the "binding problem" whereby different modalities and sensory inputs are integrated into an understood subject (e.g. a banana's color, feeling, taste, cultural reputation).

Alfred Schutz sees intentionality, or "project," as the guiding principle behind interpretation, sociology, and meaning-making: see [[verstehen]].

# Pragmatic reader-response

A consequentialist frame says, "form is secondary—because it is causal to—experience" (Dewey's [[aesthetics]] intervention). It says, "intent and process are secondary—because they are causal to—experience." This is not an opinion but a physical fact: an author may have a private intent in constructing a text, but as it is not publicly accessible, it is only the concept "intent" which will guide readers—the way an intentionality of construction _shows up in the text_, or _shows up in the dialogue between text and author biography_, rather than what the intent "really" would have been.

That is, for the purpose of an evaluated subject, what matters is only what the evaluating body interprets or understands. While there is no correct answer as to the meaning of "meaning"—that is, as to what the real or true meaning of a text is, which differs depending on which perspective on an interaction you take—there are, nonetheless, systemic realities. One such reality is the irrelevance of intent within the confines of an expression game.

One implication of this rule is that appeals to an observer or evaluator can only be made via channels, and using symbols, which are "fitted" to the evaluator's interpretive inputs. What can be got across is limited by and to the receiver's schematic affordances. If I wish to succeed in their evaluation, I must make my appeal in the language they speak; that is, using the meanings of the words as the evaluator understands them, and my success in being evaluated depends in large part on how well I am able to simulate the observer's meaning schemas. The "full truth" of the communication, insofar as it exists as a complex, multiperspectival relationship between signaler and signaled, will and can never be fully accessed. In such cases, the only reality that counts is the receiver's.
