"in the nation's best schools, faculty typically are hired (and tenured) not for their teaching skills, but for their research potential and productivity, reflecting the prevailing attitude since the Gordon and Howell report that the generation of knowledge is more highly valued than the dissemination of knowledge." (Gioia 2002)

# Olah & Carter 2017: Research Debt

The authors re-frame the "mountainous climb" that is required, to orient within a field, as a "research debt." This debt accumulated as a result of poor exposition (a lack of good explainers or introductions), half-digested ideas (that have not yet found a clear, coherent structure of explanation), bad abstractions, and a poor signal to noise ratio of published research. 

Many of these behaviors come from a shifting of labor off of explainers and onto interpreters:

> There’s a tradeoff between the energy put into explaining an idea, and the energy needed to understand it. On one extreme, the explainer can painstakingly craft a beautiful explanation, leading their audience to understanding without even realizing it could have been difficult. On the other extreme, the explainer can do the absolute minimum and abandon their audience to struggle. This energy is called interpretive labor. ^[E. Van Nostrand, 2015]

This is excerbated by an audience multiplier effect (an explanation's labor is performed once, while the interpretive labor must be performed by each audience member).

> In research, we often have a group of researchers all trying to understand each other. Just like before, the cost of explaining stays constant as the group grows, but the cost of understanding increases with each new member. At some size, the effort to understand everyone else becomes too much. As a defense mechanism, people specialize, focusing on a narrower area of interest. The maintainable size of the field is controlled by how its members trade off the energy between communicating and understanding.

Distillation is the needed response to this debt:

> Research distillation is the opposite of research debt. It can be incredibly satisfying, combining deep scientific understanding, empathy, and design to do justice to our research and lay bare beautiful insights. Distillation is also hard. It’s tempting to think of explaining an idea as just putting a layer of polish on it, but good explanations often involve transforming the idea. This kind of refinement of an idea can take just as much effort and deep understanding as the initial discovery.

# Dallas Card 2020: The case for professional science critics

> if we look again to artistic industries, there is a vital role that tends to be distinctly absent from science, namely, that of the professional critic. Although somewhat of a niche role for both music and film (at least in terms of those who manage to get paid for it) the role of the critic plays an important function in sorting through the output that is produced, providing insight, and informing the audience about what they are likely to enjoy. Far more important than that, however, **critics collectively work to establish and extend a critical discourse about the thing that they spend their time reviewing, and exert an important influence on pushing a medium in a useful and interesting direciton.**

> In the best cases... with people such as Pauline Kael, or Richard Brody, or Manny Farber, critics can be true savants who bring a unique perspective to a medium, who can take a longer-term, more sweeping view, and who can help an audience to appreciate new work on a deeper level than it otherwise would. Moreover, they arguably play an important role in shaping the evolution of a medium by promoting work that breaks new ground, and encouraging creators to take it farther.

> Again, in the best cases, critics seek out and promote fascinating, challenging, and marginalized work that might otherwise never get seen. They provide a public service in helping people to understand and appreciate new work, and to see why what is happening right now is new and exciting. The considered opinions of critics help to raise the level of public conversation, and to encourage everyone to see new work in the context of history.
