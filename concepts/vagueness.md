# Strategic vagueness

## Noncommittal vagueness

Noncommittal vagueness is an alternative but similar strategy to [[Extend-and-Retreat]]. The claim cannot be pinned down, and this is the point.

**Orwell 1946: Politics & the English Language**:

> This mixture of vagueness and sheer incompetence is the most marked characteristic of modern English prose, and especially of any kind of political writing; as soon as certain topics are raised, the concrete melts into the abstract and no one seems able to think of turns of speech that are not hackneyed: prose consists less and less of _words_ chosen for the sake of their meaning, and more and more of _phrases_ tacked together like the sections of a prefabricated hen-house.

> The word _fascism_ has now no meaning except in so far as it signifies “something not desirable.” The words _democracy_, _socialism_, _freedom_, _patriotic_, _realistic_, _justice_, have each of them several different meanings which cannot be reconciled with one another. In the case of a word like _democracy_, not only is there no agreed definition, but the attempt to make one is resisted from all sides. It is almost universally felt that when we call a country democratic we are praising it: Consequently the defenders of every kind of regime claim that it is a democracy, and fear that they might have to stop using the word if it were tied down to any one meaning.

The style is popular among pundits and politicians alike (and truly, public personalities in general, where avoiding alienating through specificity is a central goal). 

**MikkW 2020: Calibrate Words, not just probabilities (LessWrong)**: 

> Tetlock laments that television pundits almost never give probabilities for their predictions, so they basically can't be calibrated, furthermore, the events they describe are so vague that it can't even be readily agreed whether or not their predictions were correct even in retrospect. All of these things give a headache to someone who actually wants to hold pundits accountable, and to have a meaningful conversation with people who are influenced by such pundits.
