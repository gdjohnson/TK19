(fr. Curtis Yarvin)

When "sovereign power" is conferred on an "individual or institution not [formerly,] formally entrusted with it." To riff off McLuhan, it's one's 15 minutes of power in [[the First Memetic War]].

> Mere power leaks—just an engineering problem in the structure of our governments, if a quite unfixable one— cause most of the evil in the world today. Most evil is done by unaccountable power. Most of most modern governments is already mostly unaccountable, but a state outside the state is profoundly, inherently, existentially and utterly unaccountable. Its job security makes Louis XIV look like a part-time dogcatcher.
