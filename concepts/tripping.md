_Tripping is at the heart of the [[effect-ideas|effect-idea]], in aesthetics, and the psychedelic experience (cf [[REBUS]])._

Supernatural as ontological puncture, a hole in the fabric of reality.

[[Jacob Clifton]] on getting dumped:

> _Dan’s response [to getting dumped] is confused sadness, in combination with the easygoing acceptance that could have led to greater heights of pleasure than he might have imagined if he didn’t suck so greatly. It’s more interesting than that, though, because in all three stories tonight you have a rug-pull about the relationship: you thought it was like this, but it’s like that. You thought I liked you, trusted you, loved you, you thought we were on a team together forever, you thought I enjoyed your company, you thought nothing would come between us… The most painful thing about a breakup, or a momentary shame, or the embarrassment of getting played, or finding out the game behind the game, is feeling like an asshole. You were going along like everything was fine, and they knew it wasn’t fine. They lived in the real world, and you didn’t.

> When people scream and yell about getting played, or cheated on, it’s not pride. Nothing like that. It’s pain, and it’s fear: the world wrenching itself around you, from one position to another, like finding out the floor is the ceiling and always has been; that sickening coyote drop in your stomach just before you go into free-fall. The world changes around you, its angles and symmetry force themselves into new and unfamiliar shapes, and it’s terrifying and sickening; deception is betrayal less on the emotional level than an ontological one.

Henri Bergson theorized tripping. Christy Wampole summarizes:
> The French philosopher Henri Bergson had a theory about why we laugh about tripping and other such forms of awkwardness. He argued that when people are too trapped in the automaticity of their mechanical movements and when these are insufficient in dealing with the environment at hand, a comical situation presents itself. Bound by the habits of movement, people sometimes forget to adjust for new terrain or unexpected obstacles, or they get so accustomed to their standard environment, they expect the body to do all the work intuitively.

When one's predictions fail, it is much like Bergson's jolt, up and out of the automaticity of interpretation. And because action is required to correct the prediction error, a cognitive arousal takes place. 

Bergson writes:
> Perhaps there was a stone on the road. [The pedestrian] should have altered his pace or avoided the obstacle. Instead of that, through lack of elasticity... the muscles continued to perform the same [walking] movement when the circumstances of the case called for something else. That is the reason of the man's fall, and also of the people's laughter

Dennett & Hurley, _Inside Jokes_ see humor as a kind of tripping:
> Basic humor happens when you get a jolt of mirth because a belief that you, yourself, are committed to — without realizing it — becomes invalidated.

> Our brains are engaged full time in real-time (risky) heuristic search, generating presumptions about what will be experienced next in every domain. This time-pressured, unsupervised generation process has necessarily lenient standards and introduces content — not all of which can be properly checked for truth — into our mental spaces. If left unexamined, the inevitable errors in these vestibules of consciousness would ultimately continue on to contaminate our world knowledge store. So there has to be a policy of double-checking these candidate beliefs and surmisings, and the discovery and resolution of these at breakneck speed is maintained by a powerful reward system — the feeling of humor; mirth — that must support this activity in competition with all the other things you could be thinking about.
