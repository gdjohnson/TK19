[[Gifts]] are one kind of virtuous reciprocity cycle. 

Revenge is the enforcement side of reciprocity, the _eye for an eye_, tit for a tat side: returning treachery, returning violence (see _Hamlet_, or _Wuthering Heights_). Heathcliff's wife, the young Ms. Lynton, recalls—retaliatorily—that she would rather Heathcliff's suffering lessen, and he know that she be the source of some of it, than it be greater, and her role not be known. Or in Franzen's _Freedom_, Patty seeks righteous justice against her high school rapist _for the sake of justice_, to show that she was _not invisible_, that she was _someone_, that such egregious antisocial defections could not be registered against her and go unrecriminated. A community's enforcement of justice is, to some extent, the mark of being "someone" in it.

## Bird & Smith 2005: Signaling Theory, Strategic Interaction, and Symbolic Capital

_ On symbolic capital as an alternative incentive to material reciprocity._

> Detailed analysis does reveal patterns of conditional reciprocity in inter-household food sharing among several Amazonian Indian forager or forager-horticultural peoples ([e.g.] Ache living in permanent settlements). [...] But equally detailed evidence suggests that lack of attention to a recipient's past history or future probability of reciprocating is characteristic of food-sharing patterns in other widely distributed cases, such as the Ache of the Paraguayan forest while on trek

(Note to self: it doesn't have to be a universal behavioral pattern for it to be a winning pattern; evolution is only perfect over eternity, in conditions of perfect competition.)

Where gift-giving is less conditional, givers typically are incentivized by prestige gains rather than expectations of material reciprocity. But look what happens to Te Ringa:

> In many human societies it is the case that if you praise somebody else's possession it's almost impossible not to give it to the person who praises it. This is another one of those things which has a very strange moral power, so much so that you really can't break out of it. There's a great story I always tell from New Zealand, a guy named Te Ringa who was a notorious glutton. He rarely did much fishing himself, everybody else in the neighborhood was a fisherman, and he would walk up and down the beach looking for people coming back from fishing and check out their catch and say, Oh look, squid, that's my favorite, or Wow, that's a beautiful fish. Okay, here's your fish, here's your squid. You just have to give it to him. After about two years people got fed up so they formed a war party and they killed him... Such is the moral power of some customs.

# Alexander 1987: The Biology of Morality

Two types of reciprocity: direct and indirect. All known non-human reciprocity is direct: the favor is returned by the recipient of the favor. Indirect reciprocity describes situations (such as currency or capital) where the favor is returned by someone other than the recipient.

> Indirect reciprocity involves reputation and status, and results in everyone in a social group continually being assessed and reassessed by interactants, past and potential, on the basis of their interactions with others.

Trivers has referred to this as "generalized reciprocity."

Like Schilling, Alexander notes that we make strategic "investments intended to test the readiness of another to repay social debts with interest."

Crucial to inter-human competition is the idea that "success is relative": a zero-sum game is played for many resources like mates and status.

## Korsgaard 1996: The Sources of Normativity

> To hold someone responsible is to regard her as a person - that is to say, as a free and equal person, capable of acting both rationally and morally. It is therefore to regard her as someone with whom you can enter the kind of relation that is possible only among free and equal rational people: a relation of reciprocity.

## Machiavelli 1532: The Prince

Even Machiavelli's dog-eat-dog world of deception, depicted in _The Prince_, recognizes kinds of reciprocity as reliably binding:

> when a prince declares himself gallantly in favour of one side, if the party with whom he allies himself conquers, although the victor may be powerful and may have him at his mercy, yet he is indebted to him, and there is established a bond of amity; and men are never so shameless as to become a monument of ingratitude by oppressing you.
