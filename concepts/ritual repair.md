Sociology and ethnomethodology (e.g. Schegloff 1977) note that individuals frequently repair their own utterances, e.g. in the event of misarticulations, malapropisms, failure to be heard, etc. Although there is a distinction between self-repair and "other repair," the two processes look similar, and reflect some of the "charitable" or cooperative tendencies of sense-making in interaction that are reflected by e.g. [[David Lewis]] 1979, [["Scorekeeping in a Language Game"]].
