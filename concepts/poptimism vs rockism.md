## Carl Wilson: Let's Talk About Love

> If critics were so wrong about disco in the 1970s, why not about Britney Spears now? Why did pop music have to get old before getting a fair shake?

In this way, poptimism is almost post-critical—it evidences an anxiety about judgment brought on by a burdening knowledge of history.

> American sociologists Richard Peterson and Roger Keep in the mid-90s suggested that the upperclass taste model had changed from a "snob" to an "omnivore" ideal. Tey speculate that the shift corresponds to a new elite requirement to "code switch" in varied cultural settings.

See Lindsay Zoladz' self-introduction as music editor to _Vulture_:

> I’ve recently started to suspect that bragging about cultural omnivorousness has become its own form of snobbery, and that the new face of music-nerd elitism is not the High Fidelity bro but instead the Twitter user who would very much like you to applaud him for listening to Ke$ha and Sunn O))) and Florida Georgia Line and Gucci Mane and...

> What self-conscious aesthetes might be guilty of sentimentalizing [in art] is [[ambiguity]], that shibboleth of our postidealistic age. Which can make us dupes of another kind, prone to taking surface complication and opacity for depth.
