# [[Mark Fisher]], K-Punk

> As [[Simon Reynolds]] argued... it was glam that made the break which allowed punk to happen.

Glam, to Reynolds, is about "monumentalism, turning yourself into a statue, a stone idol." Compare to the [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] of _Genealogy of Morals_, who "celebrated aristocracy, nobility, and mastery."
