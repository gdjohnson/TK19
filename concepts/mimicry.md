# Holland 2012: Signals and Boundaries

> Some sphinx moths mimic hummingbirds almost perfectly, having a long proboscis that mimics a hummingbird's beak and transparent wings that beat rapidly, producing a hummingbird's "angry bee" sound. Most moth predators stay well away from a sphinx moth. Such mimicry is a prevalent outcome of coevolution.

> There are orchids, such as the "Bee orchid," that mimic particular insects so well that the insects attempt copulation with them, becoming pollen carriers in the process. Note that each insect-mimicking orchid species requires a particular insect for pollinationâ€”an extreme form of coevolution.
