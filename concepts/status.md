Bourdieu 1986, Social Space and Symbolic Power:

> It is [what [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] calls the] sense of one's place which, in interactions, leads people whom we call in French "les gens modestes," "common folks," to keep to their common place, and the others to "keep their distance," to "maintain their rank," and to "not get familiar." These strategies, it should be noted in passing, may be perfectly unconscious and take the form of what is called timidity or arrogance. In effect, social distances are inscribed in bodies or, more precisely, into the relation to the body, to language and to timeâ€”so many structural aspects of practice ignored by the subjectivist vision.
