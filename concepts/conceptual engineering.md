## Excerpts

> I have come to think that most, if not all commonly discussed philosophical concepts are inconsistent—some in the same way as truth and others in more subtle ways with one another. As such I have come to think that philosophy is, for the most part, the study of what have turned out to be inconsistent concepts. [...] On my view, the inconsistent concepts relevant to philosophy include truth, knowledge, nature, meaning, virtue, explanation, essence, causation, validity, rationality, freedom, necessity, person, beauty, belief, goodness, time, space, justice, etc. [...] The arguments consist in privileging certain constitutive principles here and others there, but ultimately the debates rarely make discernable progress because the concepts being analyzed and the concepts used to conduct the debate are defective. That is one reason philosophers end up dealing with so many paradoxes and conceptual puzzles. That is the fly bottle.

> For the past 400 years, philosophy has been shrinking. That is a sociological fact. Physics, geology, chemistry, economics, biology, anthropology, sociology, meteorology, psychology, linguistics, computer science, cognitive science—these subject matters were all part of philosophy in 1600. As the scientific revolution ground on, more and more sciences were born. This process is essentially philosophy outsourcing its subject matter as something new—sciences. The process is rather complicated, but the most important part of it is getting straight on the right concepts to use so that the subject matter can be brought under scientific methodology. Ultimately, the radical therapeutic program – showing the fly the way out of the fly bottle – is taking an active role in this outsourcing process. Identify conceptual defects (Socratic idea) and craft new concepts that avoid the old defects (Nietzschean idea) with an eye toward preparing that philosophical subject matter for outsourcing as a science. The ultimate goal of this process is the potential end of philosophy – escape for the fly...

# Spilled Reality 2020: Engineering Doctrines

Cappelen and Plunkett open their 2018 paper “[A Guided Tour of Conceptual Engineering and Ethics](https://philpapers.org/archive/CAPAGT.pdf),” with a quote from [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]’s _Will to Power_:
> Philosophers … have trusted in concepts as completely as they have mistrusted the senses: they have not stopped to consider that concepts and words are our inheritance from ages in which thinking was very modest and unclear. … What dawns on philosophers last of all: they must no longer accept concepts as a gift, nor merely purify and polish them, but first make and create them, present them and make them convincing. Hitherto one has generally trusted one's concepts as if they were a wonderful dowry from some sort of wonderland: but they are, after all, the inheritance from our most remote, most foolish as well as most intelligent ancestors. …What is needed above all is an absolute skepticism toward all inherited concepts.

It’s a good reminder that this diseasing of 20th century philosophy—its mixture of “functional monism” (the conceit of a one-to-one relationship between handles and reality) and “classical concepts” (as having sufficient and necessary conditions)—was not a universal affliction. It appears most of the century’s “great” thinkers grasped it as a problem far ahead of broader adoption or articulation. Dewey’s pragmatism is a _de facto _solution to verbal and frame dispute and thus an acknowledgment of terms’ untethering from wordly structures; [[Wittgenstein]] anticipates cognitive science by half a century; and [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] writes in _Twilight of Idols_ of a man “stuck in a cage, imprisoned among all sorts of terrible concepts.” Carnapian explication is undergoing a 180-degree revision, no longer considered defeated by Quine as previously assumed.

One enticing part of the [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] quote, in my mind, is its comparison to the “mistrusted” senses. It would be egregious had philosophy not learned until recently to distinguish between the world as it is and the world as it is apprehended by our senses; I’d like to suggest that philosofolly’s previous conception of language and concepts is equally egregious.

There are so many causes of messy handles that even a cursory examination of the process by which humans invent and disseminate them subverts any modeling of them as “tidy” or monistic. But I’d like to introduce one frame, adapted from NNT: the Procrustean bed, where bad carvings—simplifications or Platonifications—amputate important parts of the whole, or else “stretch” it to fit a desired factoring. (Procrustes is a mythical figure who would lop off or stretch out his guests' limbs in his home, so they would perfectly fit his bed.) It’s a barbarism masquerading as hospitality, so to speak. Think of the [game of telephone](https://suspendedreason.com/2020/06/02/the-telephone-effect-and-the-reciprocity-of-perspectives/), or Chinese whispers, by which each successive adapter unconsciously and consciously “stretches” or “amputates” the term as learned to fit with his models and experience of reality.

But now we have these garbage bins of concepts, and Cappelen & Plunkett want to improve them—engineer them. Construction has a rich vocabulary here that might diversify “engineering”: _retrofit_, _renovate_, _refurbish_, _remodel_, all of which have meaningfully distinct denotations. Perhaps someone will adopt them, but for now, the core questions of conceptual engineering, to C&P:

1.  How ought we assess concepts, both in determining _which_ existing concepts need engineering, and, once engineered, whether the new formulations are _improvements_ over predecessors?
2.  How important is the genealogy, or history, of a concept in making engineering decisions?

Expanding on the first question, what sorts of defects might our representational devices (“handles”) possess? The pair present:

1.  Cognitive defects (which distort reasoning)
2.  Moral or political defects (which undermine our values)
3.  Theoretical defects (which undermine philosophical progress)
4.  Semantic defects (incoherence or incompleteness)

While the entailments of #2 and #4 are very clear to me, the odd-numbered items are less so. I could suggest that the “all under one roof” problem of conflation and linguistic over-burdening is one of the central failure sources of conceptual disputes, but perhaps this is a “cognitive” or “theoretical” defect. Similarly, I would point to back-coherence (in the sense of preserving genealogy) as holding back concepts from being their best selves; still, I can’t pretend that maintaining the coherence of historical texts via such a historical continuity is unimportant.

(Sidenote: One core divide C&P attempt to grapple with is externalism or internalism, but until presented with a compelling argument otherwise, I’ll consider, in the spirit of “[generalized compatibilism](https://spilledreality.tumblr.com/post/620839172988715009/generalized-compatibilism),” these stances as perfectly congenial in their abstract formulations. Internalism, C&P write, is the view that a concept or utterance’s “meaning depends on facts about” what’s inside an individuals “head”; externalism holds that “meaning is determined at least in part by facts having to do with the history of linguistic usage, or complex use patterns over time, or the judgments of experts.” I’ll classify this as a verbal dispute similar to literary theory’s [Meaning Wars](https://spilledreality.tumblr.com/post/619134470448185344/false-dichotomies-toward-meaning-compatibilism): it is clearly the case that the models in people’s “heads” [and bodies] are built from external norms and histories, and that there is both a descriptive fact about the society’s aggregate usage and the individual’s neural interpretation, and that the only source of contention at play is which of these ought to be called a concept’s “meaning.” Crucially, if two people or groups in contention don’t refer to the same “thing” in thingspace, they’re not having a disagreement; they’re talking past each other. Social meaning and individual meaning are clearly different “things”—or more accurately, “processes”—both clearly real.)

But I’m getting off-track: I want to talk about two doctrines I’d propose as crucial for any would-be conceptual engineer. There are plenty of smaller considerations which the current literature neglects; one is the [metaphorical fabric](https://spilledreality.tumblr.com/post/620394810854998016/conceptual-engineering-cognitive-metaphor) which holds our concepts together and forms an important axis of meaning; the other is the [linguistic conquests](https://spilledreality.tumblr.com/post/617030293339144192/linguistic-conquests) constantly performed on language, and the way these refactorings create variability in the field of meaning. But these addendums can come later; for now:

*   _The doctrine of non-intervention_. Concepts should—in part because they can only, with any efficacy—be engineered locally. Only locals know the affordances of their specific use cases. Philosophers ought to engineer philosophical concepts, but leave fishing concepts to the fishermen. Engineering-on-behalf ought only _provide possibilities_ for bottom-up adoption; it should never limit possibilities by top-down imposition.
*   _The illumination doctrine_. Concepts should help illuminate the world, but never obscure it. This is especially important in ameliorative or ethical-political projects.

The non-intervention doctrine is partly an attempt to prevent the failures of “high modernism,” or “systemism,” or “[overhaulism](https://suspendedreason.com/2020/06/02/overhaulism/)” (James Scott’s, John Gall’s, and [Ari Holtzman](http://crispychicken.cc/)’s terms, respectively). In areas of vast complexity, such as the intersection of language and human psychology, unknown nth-order effects dominate the landscape of consequences. Most recently, this hubristic approach was found in the behavioral economics of Kahneman and Tversky, who made grand, rationalistic claims about local domains like profession [[sports|basketball]], of which they knew absolutely nothing, naively supposing that the local expertise and folklore of these domains were merely riddled by cognitive biases (as opposed to having been weeded out based on what “works”—e.g. the hot hand “fallacy”). Perhaps the surest safeguard against the failures of overhaulism is allowing local communities to freely adopt those terms which work for them, and freely ignore those which don’t. To the would-be conceptual engineer I say: model and advocate, but never impose.

The illumination doctrine is founded on an ethics of accuracy. There is much danger in normative, ethics-based, “activistic” linguistic meddling. When top-down imposed, such conceptual engineering projects are well-known to us via writers like Orwell. While individual engineers almost without exception believe that their individual intervention on language is for the greater good (in the great tradition of noble lies), limiting the thinkable ought to be viewed as assailing free speech. (Recall also that once a technology is utilized for one political end, a tacit allowance of a _class _of strategy has taken place, and the technology will be co-opted by the other side: victimhood and identity politics’ adoption by the right is a recent & relevant example.) Expressive liberties are premised not just on the ability to say, but on the existence of an expressive language which enable the sayable.

Both these doctrines join the doctrine of _preserved ground_ discussed in a previous post on conceptual engineering. There I distinguished between two types of linguistic “conquests” that re-carve the language, seeing the “[[divide-and-conquer|divide and conquer]]” method as healthier for the language, in the long run, than the “narrow and conquer” approach:
> First, the _narrow and conquer_ method, where a specific sub-sense of a concept is taken to be its "true" or "essential" meaning, the core which defines its "concept-ness." To give an example from discourse, Taleb defines the concept rationality as "What survives, period." The second style I termed _[[divide-and-conquer|divide and conquer]]_, where multiple sub-senses are distinguished and named in an attempt to preserve all relevant sub-senses while also gaining the ability to talk about one specific sub-sense. To give an example from discourse, Yudkowsky separates “rationality” into “epistemic rationality”—the pursuit of increasingly predictive models which are "true" in a loose correspondence sense—and “instrumental rationality”—the pursuit of models which lead to in-the-world flourishing, e.g. via adaptive self-deception or magical thinking—rationality as “what works.”
> 
> Conquests by narrowing throw out all the richly bundled senses of a concept while keeping only the immediately useful—it's wasteful in its parsimony. It leaves not even a ghost of these other senses' past, advertising itself as the original bundled whole while erasing the richness which once existed there. It leads to verbal disputes, term confusion, talking past each other. It impoverishes our language.
> 
> Division preserves the original, bundled concept in full, documenting and preserving the different senses rather than purging all but the one. It advertises this history; intended meaning, received meaning—the qualifier indicates that these are hypernyms of "meaning," which encompasses them both. Not just this, but the qualifier indicates the character of the subsense in a way that a narrowed umbrella original never will. Our understanding of the original has been improved even as our instrumental ability to wield its subsenses grows. Instead of stranding itself from discourse at large, the divided term has clarified discourse at large.

_comparison to [[Excess of Signification]]_

**crispy_chicken**

(1) What makes us reach for more than our common speak? We never end up describing anything in its entirety. If a bounce a ball on the floor and say "The ball bounced!" I am missing a lot of what "really" happened and a lot about what I was able to perceive. We run into the ends of this all the time, when someone does something funny with their face while they talk that makes you grin, but you can't quite put it into words and you just say "You made a funny face." Sure we have this notion of "instrumentally useful", but I guess that seems more like an observation of what people do than how: how do people decide on instrumentally useful strategies for description?

(2) That's a bit more abstract than I mean it to be, but what I'm really trying to figure out is what you mean by "shrink the fly":

the fly will never fully leave the fly bottle, as science can never fully dispose of the excess of signification, but you may be able to shrink the fly until only metaphysics, a parallel of divine understanding, remains, alongside the arts and esoteric or religious practices

I guess my underlying discomfort with this description comes from the perception of Science's attempt and failure at exactitude. While I agree that, as a PR stunt that a lot of people believe and even more people give lip service too along the lines of Communism or Democracy, Science does pretend it's trying to be very descriptive. But exactly because the excess of signification calls a lot of spillover, Science ends up describing a lot of things that it "shouldn't" be able to if the purported limits of the Scientific Method were respected. What really distinguishes it from art of religious practice at that point? Isn't the excess of signification really something about our ability to communicate with each other? I don't think this is antithetical to the quote (which I quite like), in fact this is what I perceive it to be saying, but I read something slightly different in your analysis and am wondering if we actually diverge?

(3) I think in terms of positioning, I get the feeling all of use here end-up in the same place, though I'd be curious to know if I'm wrong: the Enlightenment was interesting because it made people curious and hungry to cut things up into replaceable pieces. But in reality, all the observable things that seem to really matter aren't replaceable, except at scales so tiny that modeling emergent phenomena is not just difficult for current computers, it is likely physically impossible the "map as big as the territory" way. So now we're in a situation where we're trying to find a new way to cut things up less violently, but we can't agree where our index fingers point and what the limits of the object are, so it's a very difficult co-ordination game.

**snav**

Ah I think re #2 im using Science in the enlightenment sense rather than the institutional sense: i totally agree there are branches of "pseudo-science" that lay claim to being Science but don't function within the empirical paradigm, and I think they're one of the most common ways to "soak up" the "excess" (which I also think is sad/actively bad but that's a very personal judgment)

Re #3 what do you mean by replaceable? I get the sense I agree but I can't quite follow
#1 might be about social games/dynamics which is a topic im not highly versed in, but maybe graham has thoughts on... communication beyond pure instrumentality is always wrapped in tiny little [[status]] games, supposedly

**crispy_chicken**

Re #3 what do you mean by replaceable? I get the sense I agree but I can't quite follow

By replaceable I mean a place where the signifier can stand-in for the signified without loss of information. When we talk about an electron there's a reasonable argument to be made that, even if our mental models differ, as long as we make recourse to the same foundational knowledge (e.g. the Wikipedia description of an electron, CERN's studies, etc.) we can agree on its relationships to other things with enough discussion. Thing are not replaceable, when we rely on a leap-of-faith that we are describing the same thing: when someone says "I love you." you have no way to meaningfully verify that their "love" is the same as yours.

# Cappelen & Dever 2019: Bad Language

> we have no good reason to think that our language contains words that when combined will exactly pick out what "lie" picks out. We don't have that for "red" or "love" (if you don't believe me try to think of reductive definitions for them!) and in general there's no good reason to expect language to have such resources. 

# Conceptual marxism

Patrick Greenough:

> At the extreme right-wing, is Conceptual Conservatism, the view that our everyday concepts are perfectly in order as they are: philosophy should leave everything just as it is. In the centre-left, is Conceptual Explication, the view that our everyday concepts are typically too rough-hewn as they stand to feature in rigorous philosophical theory. Such concepts need dressing and polishing if they are to be fit for the building of theory. At the extreme left, is Conceptual Marxism, the view that many (if not most) of our ordinary concepts are, for various reasons, unfit for bearing the load of useful philosophical explanations

# Against the Logicians 2014: Deleuze's production of concepts

> For those who find [[Wittgenstein]]’s critique of contemporary philosophical problem-solving compelling, but who resist the idea that philosophy should be nothing more than Wittgensteinian therapy, where can philosophy go?

> Continuing from where an earlier post left off, one answer would be to agree with Gilles Deleuze that philosophy should be engaged in “the production of concepts.” This is very different from the puzzle-solving philosophy that [[Wittgenstein]] critiques. Whether this puzzle-solving is labeled by its practitioners as a form of analytic philosophy or an alternative to it, it is motivated by the attempt to discover the answers to philosophical problems. It assumes, against Wittgenstein, that there are correct answers to these problems, and that these answers can be determined by logical inference from the linguistic materials at hand, whether these materials come from intuition, natural science, or psychological experiment.

> A philosophy based on the production of concepts, by contrast, would seek to create rather than discover, to make rather than find. It could be seen as dedicated to the creation of new “vocabularies,” in [[Richard Rorty]]’s use of the term. These new vocabularies might serve some of our ends better than the vocabularies we already use.
