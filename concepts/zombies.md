The zombie, as it emerges in the 20th C, is a potent symbol of the impending monoculture, the post-war emergence of "ideology" as a metaphorical parasite on its host, and desires for "authenticity" or freedom within the top-down narratives that were increasingly bearing down on modern man.

On 2019's _Joker_ film:

> Has the vacancy of the zombie been replaced by the violent absurdity of the Joker because of the recent malevolent political appropriation of absurdism in the service of narcissism? Narcissism is the last ditch defence of decadent narrative ontology.  It is the idolatry of narrative trying absurdly to become self-causing and self-sufficient because it anxiously knows it has no cosmic warrant.
