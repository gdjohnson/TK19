We overhype a technology, get bored and forget about it after it doesn't materialize in a year or two, and are amazed when it happens—has happened, because we find out only after the fact. "Oh yes, there's an HIV vaccine now."

> The [[death of the author]] begins with a true premise, which is that the meaning of a work may not be what the author consciously intended – so often we are unaware of our own motivations, although a good author should be more aware – so it may be that the author is wrong about what his work means. The viewpoints of a character within a work are not necessarily the viewpoints of an author, but the author’s sincere beliefs about the world are always present in the text, in one form or another. If they are not explicitly stated, then they are implicit. In my opinion, Barthes’ formulation elides this distinction. 
> 
> A similar failure mode is present in Derrida’s notion of the trace, which he uses to produce his deconstructions. Derrida says that whatever is not mentioned in the work is present by virtue of its absence. This is tautological, and it allows him to add anything to any work he wants, and then claim, “because the text doesn’t say this, the shadow of what it doesn’t say hangs over it, and because of this latent contradiction, it deconstructs itself.” 
> 
> In both cases, you have a truth:
> 
> Barthes – an author may communicate something he does not intend
> Derrida – there may be a conspicuous absence
> Which is then exaggerated into a falsehood:
> 
> Barthes – the intentions of the author are irrelevant
> Derrida – the absence of a concept is evidence of its centrality
