# Connections to surrogation frame

From "Looking Glass Self" Wiki entry:
> In hypothesizing the framework, "the mind is mental" because "the human mind is social". From the time they are born, humans define themselves within the context of their social interactions. **Children learn that the symbol of their crying will elicit a response from their caregivers, not only when they are in need of necessities such as food or a diaper change, but also when they are in need of attention.** Cooley best explains this interaction in On Self and Social Organization, noting that "a growing solidarity between mother and child parallels the child's increasing competence in using significant symbols. This simultaneous development is itself a necessary prerequisite for the child's ability to adopt the perspectives of other participants in social relationships and, thus, for the child's capacity to develop a social self.
    
It seems like there are meaningful similarities between how SI's "symbol" and the "surrogate" idea—if you generalize this sense of "symbol" so it becomes synonymized with a generalized "sign"—encompassing everything from crying (emotional performance) to a fashion choice to a linguistic utterance or taxonomic category to an evaluative metric—essentially, the "unit of communication" (a compound of sensorily salient cue/s + the conceptual-pragmatic entailments of those cues)
    
The social or cultural world is a field of symbolic meanings (entailments, reputations...) that shapes our behavior—these symbolic meanings are something like "the extrinsic consequences/effects" of behavior. (Eg you dress for intrinsic reasons like comfort/warmth and extrinsic reasons a la fashion/appearance)
    
So the fashion field, the "landscape of cultural associations" that e.g. [[Kevin Simler]] talks about in "Ads Don't Work That Way", what objects "mean" in a more-than-PvE way—these are the symbolic field

I guess what I'm effectively looking for is a symbolic-interactionist account of language
