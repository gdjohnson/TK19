"Individual imagination is weak; evolution is strong." (Perry 2015)

Man lacks many of the physical adaptations of other animals; he has no innate ability to smell water from miles, like the camels, or to hunt prey bare-handed. What he has is culture, which evolves more quickly than biology, and thus makes him the most adaptable creature on the globe. [[Protagoras]], in his "Great Speech" (as represented by Plato) conveys this truth metaphorically through myth:

> Now Epimetheus, being not so wise as he might be, heedlessly squandered his stock of properties on the brutes; he still had left unequipped the race of men, and was at a loss what to do with it. As he was casting about, Prometheus arrived to examine his distribution, and saw that whereas the other creatures were fully and suitably provided, man was naked, unshod, unbedded, unarmed; and already the destined day was come, whereon man like the rest should emerge from earth to light. Then Prometheus, in his perplexity as to what preservation he could devise for man, stole from Hephaestus and Athena wisdom in the arts together with fire... [man] soon was enabled by his skill to articulate speech and words, and to invent dwellings, clothes, sandals, beds, and the foods that are of the earth. 

Émile Chartier:

> Every boat is copied from another boat... Let’s reason as follows in the manner of Darwin. It is clear that a very badly made boat will end up at the bottom after one or two voyages, and thus never be copied... One could then say, with complete rigor, that it is the sea herself who fashions the boats, choosing those which function and destroying the others.

# Henrich, Conversations with Tyler

> COWEN: [[Friedrich Hayek|Hayek]] had a theory that we still have atavistic instincts. We have the instincts of a collectivist people with strong sharing norms, which we needed when we were near subsistence. But we’re now much wealthier and these norms are dysfunctional and, in fact, they give us a bad politics. Agree, disagree? What’s your take on this?
>
> HENRICH: I think I can agree with the broad claim. One of the things we always face in complex societies, meritocratic-based societies, is there’s a tendency for people to want to surround themselves by people that are loyal to them, by family and friends and people who owe them things, right? We call this corruption. In most human societies, this was called business as usual.
>
> There is this tendency to want to surround yourself with those loyal to you, those of your same tribe, ethnic group, all those kinds of things. Maintaining well-functioning institutions requires constantly resisting the tendency to surround yourself with reciprocal partners and family members that would otherwise corrupt the system.
>
> COWEN: Let me try a somewhat related question. I’m not at all intending this as asking you about your personal views on politics. But let me pose the question, and then circle back to what I’m really trying to ask.
>
> I look at your research. You have papers. We learn better from teachers who are like us in some way, maybe slightly senior, but they’re similar in terms of their groups. Religion is something that’s very prosocial. There’s a kind of wisdom in intuitions about repugnance. Not always, but often. There’s a wisdom to these carried intuitions.
>
> There’s a high value to cultural evolution. War in some cases can foster cooperation, especially over the longer haul. Biology really matters, and the West is quite distinctive in terms of what we do and how we think and the culture we’ve developed.
>
> I’m not trying to ask personally are your views conservative. But in some temperamental sense, if I can just whisper this, do you ever feel even here, does it make you conservative believing all these things?
>
> HENRICH: I just follow the trail where it goes. I don’t think of these things as conservative ideas although —
>
> COWEN: I don’t mean conservative in the sense of modern political parties, but in the sense of the broad sweep of human history there are conservative thinkers such as Edmund Burke would be one, or Adam Smith.

[8:34 AM] suspendedreason:
> While Henrich’s work follows the cultural evolution research paradigm that began largely with the publication of social scientists Robert Boyd and Peter J. Richerson’s foundational work _Culture and the Evolutionary Process_ (1985), Scruton cites earlier conservative thinkers such as 18th century political philosopher Edmund Burke.
> The convergence here is interesting because you have two largely independent projects: one rooted in centuries of political philosophy, and the other in decades worth of comparatively obscure academic work, that have reached similar conclusions.
> The primary intersection between the two camps is economist Friedrich [[Friedrich Hayek|Hayek]]. [[Friedrich Hayek|Hayek]]’s work is discussed extensively by Scruton, and has been (briefly) cited in both Boyd and Richerson’s, and Henrich’s work.
[8:49 PM] lambdaphagy: honestly, Boyd and Richerson was a huge redpill
[8:49 PM] lambdaphagy: comme on dit
[9:04 PM] lambdaphagy: to learn that cultural transmission can produce "knowledge without knowers"
[9:05 PM] lambdaphagy: and that elements of a culture can be load-bearing without the members of the culture knowing, let alone being able to defend at the level of detailed argument, why that element is load-bearing
[9:07 PM] snav: knowing-how vs knowing-why
[9:15 PM] snav: cool part too is you can have a "knowing why" that doesn't explain anything at all really, like mythical/magical explanations
[9:15 PM] snav: in the sense that their inner logic is rational but they have no systematic context
[9:57 PM] crispy_chicken: most answers to "why" are like this
[10:10 PM] snav: REEE NOOOOO MUH EMPIRICISM
[6:42 AM] suspended reason: Having read the prologue/first chapter to Nature of Order this morning that seems baked-in. The "mechanistic view" of the world
[6:43 AM] suspended reason: It also ties into that conversation @lambdaphagy with Nico about taste and justifying taste, and then later at the dinner table we talked about bureaucratic [[justification]], grantwriting and stuff
[6:44 AM] suspended reason: If you're constantly proxying for X skill with "the ability of the skill-holder to represent their skill in language," you filter out aphrasiac talents and filter in skill-less PR agents
[6:46 AM] suspended reason: That said, I think specifically in VizArts, it's not the most unwelcome thing to spend a century on a "linguistic turn"—it opened up avenues for conceptual practices and textual art that were fully blockaded pre-1900—but it seems important to at least acknowledge that trade-off, and think about how to mitigate it/what the Pareto frontier is of genres
[6:55 AM] suspended reason: Anyway, I'm sure some of y'all have read the recent scholars-stage, that makes this basic sweep of connecting Henrich, conservatism, [[Friedrich Hayek|Hayek]]
[6:56 AM] suspended reason: At the end he talks about how this model of tradition works with a world where you expect tomorrow to be like yesterday
[6:56 AM] suspended reason: But if you take a view of the world as rapidly changing, perhaps all you're left with is "rationality" (in the abstract thinking, hypothetical, visualization sense)
[6:57 AM] suspended reason: Also, vestigial features of a society/culture stack up a heckuva lot faster
[6:59 AM] suspended reason: So the Chesterton's fence dilemma becomes more complicated: "Well, there probably was a purpose 100 years ago, but we're no longer an agrarian economy, and I can't really envision what that purpose was, and I do happen to know the benefits of removing the fence"
[7:03 AM] suspended reason: What you're left with is a useful devil on the shoulder, whispering risks in your ear—"the world is more complex than you imagine; the best-laid plans  can go haywire; interfering in the status quo can backfire"—but not any sense of how bearish vs bullish to be
[7:04 AM] suspended reason: In other words, there's no heuristic to be gained because it's the particulars of a specific domain/situation that matter most
[7:05 AM] suspended reason: It's good to know you can over-bake things, and what it means to burn food, but that doesn't help you figure out the appropriate cook time on an apple pie
