There's a lot going on here, but I'd like to note two things:

(1) The major reason we feel the need to make social reasoning explicit—especially when we would like to say that something isn't the case—is that we are fighting a default assumption. For instance, when my mother says "Wow! You've grown up to be so handsome! Not that you weren't before!" she is fighting the common understanding that people make such observations upon experiencing a _change_.

(2) These notions of defaults are very fluid and individual—we are only ever guessing what other people will "see" as defaults. And when we get it wrong we show our had. If I tack-on "Not that I thought you were ugly." as an addendum that the recipient didn't even consider needing, I show that I leaned towards a phrasing that would imply just that. The battle for these interpretations is why sarcasm, back-handed compliments, etc. are the entry-level game into wit, i.e., recreational strategic interaction
