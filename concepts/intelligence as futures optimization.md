_See also [[Strategic Interaction]]._

Austen calls the ability to see into the future, [[generalized reading|read individuals]], and act [[strategic interaction|strategically]] "penetration." In _The Count of Monte Cristo_, Dumas refers to a granite wall as being "as impenetrable as futurity."

> Steering the future, not energy or mass, not food or bullets, is the raw currency of conflict and cooperation among agents.  Kasparov competed against Deep Blue to steer the chessboard into a region where he won - knights and bishops were only his pawns... this - computationally-frugal cross-domain future-steering - is the necessary and sufficient meaning that the wise should attach to the word, "intelligence"

# Yudkowsky: Aiming at the Target

> When I think you're a powerful intelligence, and I think I know something about your preferences, then I'll predict that you'll steer reality into regions that are higher in your preference ordering. Think of a huge circle containing all possible outcomes, such that outcomes higher in your preference ordering appear to be closer to the center.  Outcomes between which you are indifferent are the same distance from the center - imagine concentric rings of outcomes that are all equally preferred.  If you aim your actions and strike a consequence close to the center - an outcome that ranks high in your preference ordering - then I'll think better of your ability to aim.
