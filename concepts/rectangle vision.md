(fr. [[Sarah Perry]])

The phenomenology of a man-made world, where the rectangle—entirely absent in nature—dominates our visual landscape. The monolith in Kubrick's _2001_ works off this motif.

Kanye West, 2021 GQ interview:

> Literally and figuratively, we live in boxes. We leave the womb when we are born and get put directly into the tomb. We get put directly into our first square space which is the beginning of us going from being multi-dimensional and completely imaginative to placed onto a grid... First it starts off with the crib, then we go to schools where that’s a box, then we go to higher learning a lot of times and that’s a box and then we end up at a job where we are working inside of a box and we do that to try to buy a crib, actually, and then we, you know, have children and put our children in a crib.

[[Sam Fussell]], 2014 Interview with Dr. Michael Joyner:

> I am not a hunting guide in Montana. I am a hunter in Montana.  And this is why: a man drives his rectangular car into a rectangular supermarket lot. He passes the other rectangular cars on the way to park in his rectangular parking spot. He exits his vehicle and walks to the market. Along the way, he picks up a rectangular shopping cart.  He pushes his cart into the supermarket. The supermarket, as a building, is a large rectangle.
> The man pushes his cart to the frozen meat section. He eyes the offerings.  The meat, be it chicken or beef, is wrapped in a rectangular package.
> The man leans forward and selects a rectangular package of meat from the display and proceeds to the check-out line.
> He places the meat on the rubber moving counter, the counter in the shape of rectangle. He pulls from his wallet, which is the shape of a rectangle, a bill. The bill is the shape of a rectangle. Though he could have used a debit or charge card. Also the shape of a rectangle.
> So why do I hunt? Why am I a subsistence hunter who hunts all of his meat from the woods instead of buying it from the store?
> Because life is not rectangular.
> Because the meat I eat is earned not with a piece of paper but with my own sweat and work in the woods. Through detective work: tracking animals, learning their habits, their proclivities, etc.

The rectangular nature of modern life is related to James C. Scott's [[legibility]] concept as well as (loosely, via Sam Fussell's observations) the [[surrogation]] and [[simulacra]] concepts.
