## Collins: Interaction Ritual Chains

*On how complex societies unbundle identity contingent on local networks:*

> Most individuals are known only inside local networks, and invisible outside of them no matter their fame inside... the status order is invisible, or visible only within specialized networks; occupation and wealth does not get deference, nor form visible status groups broadcasting categorical identities. Public interaction is an equality without much solidarity, an enactment of personal distance mitigated by a tinge of mutual politeness and shared casualness. [Erving Goffman] calls it the order of civil disattention.

> Categorical identities have largely disappeared, replaced by pure local personal reputations in networks where one is known, and by anonymity outside.

## Paglia 1992: Sexual Personaeâ€”The Cancelled Preface:

> After endless quarrels with authority, prankish disruptiveness, and impatience with management and procedure, I now see the hierarchical as both beautiful and necessary. Efficiency liberates; egalitarianism tangles, delays, blocks, deadens. I marvel, in fact, at the extraordinary orderliness of human life, which must be the instinctual brain-based recall of the individual to the group. Even the gods, the preeminent sexual personae of this book, are projections fo our innate biological hierarchism. 

> In history, the human drive is toward monarchy. Western culture has produced the best system yet for organizing and taming these king-seeking energies: representative democracy, part of our pagan heritage. But our atavistic longings for hierarchy are satisfied by another pagan institution, Hollywood, with its charismatic, imperial stars.
