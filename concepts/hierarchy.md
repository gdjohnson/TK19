## Collins: Interaction Ritual Chains

*On how complex societies [[bundling|unbundle]] identity contingent on local networks:*

> Most individuals are known only inside local networks, and invisible outside of them no matter their fame inside... the status order is invisible, or visible only within specialized networks; occupation and wealth does not get deference, nor form visible status groups broadcasting categorical identities. Public interaction is an equality without much solidarity, an enactment of personal distance mitigated by a tinge of mutual politeness and shared casualness. [[[Erving Goffman]]] calls it the order of civil disattention.

> Categorical identities have largely disappeared, replaced by pure local personal reputations in networks where one is known, and by anonymity outside.
