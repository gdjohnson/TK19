# Romanticism

Keats in private correspondence:

> I had not a dispute but a disquisition with Dilke, upon various subjects; several things dove-tailed in my mind, and at once it struck me what quality went to form a Man of Achievement, especially in Literature, and which Shakespeare possessed so enormously—I mean Negative Capability, that is, when a man is capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason—Coleridge, for instance, would let go by a fine isolated verisimilitude caught from the Penetralium of mystery, from being incapable of remaining content with half-knowledge.

[[Mark Fisher]]:

> Romanticism is the dressing-up of Teenage Ontology as an aesthetic cosmology. Teenage Ontology is governed by the conviction that what really matters is interiority: how you _feel_ inside, and what your _experiences_ and _opinions_ are.

"Where the Romantic style is characterized by continuing growth and change, the classical style exhibits completeness, order, and unity."

> This was the first great age of biography, autobiography, and autobiographical literary creation—this was the age when writers began writing above all about themselves.

> A reverence for nature, vegetarianism and environmental consciousness, the radical theory of anarchism and the conservative theory of the organic state, the cult of personality and the very idea of sincerity, the reinvention of poetry as the expression of the self, the belief that nothing matters more to us as human beings than our sensations, our feelings; that individualism and an individual's ideals whatever they may be define our freedom and our modernity; the practice of free love and the establishment of idealistic communes; the vogue for naturalness in dress—no powdered wig—a figure-hugging dress resembling a chemise; short hair for women and long hair for men; the conception of the _aesthetic_ which is to say a philosophical theory of beauty; the modern meanings of the words _imagination_, _creativity_, _genius_, _literature_; the freedom fighter on the streets and the hiker in the mountains; the seaside holiday and the cult of celebrity; a public appetite for sensation; the vampire story and the science fiction novel; the worship of Shakespeare; the alarming notion that it might be glamorous to take drugs or commit suicide or the very least to live hard and die young; _weltschmerz_ and _ennui_; the rebel and the outsider; the egotist and the altruist—these are all ideas that emerge or grew in the Romantic Age.

Return to nature is the spirit of the movement. 

> Think now of the idea of rights as a circle of expanding circumference. The French Revolution proclaims the rights of man.  Wollstencraft advocates the rights of woman, Clarkson the rights of slaves. Then in 1791 John Oswald, a Scottish Jacobin in revolutionary Paris, issues _The Cry of Nature, or: An appeal to mercy and justice on behalf of the persecuted animals_, arguing the case for the rights of nature, and becoming one of the first to espouse vegetarianism.

John Frank Newton publishes in 1811 _Return to Nature, or A Defense of the vegetable nature._ Shelley becomes a passionate vegetarian. 

William Godwin: Wollstencraft's husband, and the inventor of philosophical anarchism, perceiving man as fundamentally good but corrupted by institutions (from government to marriage). He was opposed in this by Burke.

# James Wood, discussing DeWitt's Last Samurai for the New Yorker

> “Rational” is Sibylla’s favorite word, often repeated. Kurosawa’s film, she remarks, is essentially “about the importance of rational thought.” She advises her son that, having turned six, he is “old enough to act like a rational human being.” When Ludo bargains for ice cream, she warns him to try to “act as a rational human being.” Most people, Sibylla thinks, are habitually illogical: “They could probably be rational quite easily if they were properly taught.” But there is almost nothing rational about being a parent, beginning with the pure surplus of conception. And children and parents have a hard time agreeing on what is rational. If a child’s desire for ice cream is perfectly rational to a child, so is his need to know the identity of his father, or the reasons for his mother’s unhappiness. Behind “The Last Samurai,” shadowing it but subtly unmentioned, lies the failed project of John Stuart Mill’s highly rational upbringing. Mill learned Greek at the age of three—he was “properly taught”—but at twenty he doubted if he could go on living. In his “Autobiography,” Mill recounts a spiritual crisis that, he realized, his education had partly precipitated. Mill blamed his unhappiness on long habits of “precocious and premature analysis” that had steadily separated him from “the very culture of the feelings.” **Discovering, at last, the salvation of Wordsworth’s poetry, Mill felt himself reconnected to natural beauty, and to “the common feelings and common destiny of human beings.” Ludo yearns for some of that precious commonality; his burden is to have a mother who is unable to weigh its importance.**
