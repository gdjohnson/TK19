"The history of philosophy is to a great extent that of a certain clash of human temperaments." (James 1907: Pragmatism)

The pragmatic tradition is one of [[indexicality|context-sensitivity]] and [[localism]]. [[Pragmatic ontology]] is purposive and goal-oriented; spaces are carved up depending on the task on wishes to achieve with the carving. (Required distinctions, slack for conflations.)

## The present dilemma in philosophy

[[William James|James]] presents a picture of two presently incompatible temperaments: rationalism and materialism, one idealistic, the other deflationary. Neither is sufficient, James writes—rationalism refuses to engage with the concrete facts of living, and can offer very little guidance to living, which is in large part the purpose of philosophy. But materialism is unable to fulfill our quasi-religious desires for meaning, purpose.

> The actual universe is a thing wide open, but rationalism makes systems, and systems must be closed.

> [Our intellectualist philosophies] exquisitely satisfy that craving for a refined object of contemplation which is so powerful an appetite of the mind. But I ask you in all seriousness to look abroad on this colossal universe of concrete facts, on their awful bewilderments, their surprises and cruelties, on the wilderness which they shouw, and then to tell me whether "refined" is the one inevitable descriptive adjective that springs to your lips.

> [These rationalisms are] far less an account of this actual world than a clear addition built upon it, a classic sanctuary in which the rationalist fancy may take refuge from the intolerably confused and gothic character which mere facts present. It is no _explanation_ of our concrete universe, it is...  a substitute for it, a remedy, a way of escape.

> When the pragmatist undertakes to show in detail just WHY we must defer, the rationalist is unable to recognize the concretes from which his own abstraction is taken. He accuses us of DENYING truth; whereas we have only sought to trace exactly why people follow it and always ought to follow it. Your typical ultra-abstractionist fairly shudders at concreteness: other things equal, he positively prefers the pale and spectral. If the two universes were offered, he would always choose the skinny outline rather than the rich thicket of reality. It is so much purer, clearer, nobler.

## What pragmatism means

[[William James|James]] presents pragmatism as a [[Generalized Compatibilism|compatibilist]] solution to the insufficiences of either rationalism or materialism on their own.

> the scholastic adage that whenever you meet a contradiction you must make a distinction
 
> The pragmatic method is primarily a method of settling metaphysical disputes that otherwise might be interminable. Is the world one or many?—fated or free?—material or spiritual? [...] The pragmatic method in such cases is to try to interpret each notion by tracing its respective practical consequences.

> Mr. [[C.S. Peirce|Peirce]], after pointing out that our beliefs are really rules for action, said that, to develop a thought's meaning, we need only determine what conduct is is fitted to produce: that conduct is for us its sole significance.

> "All realities influence our practice," [[[C.S. Peirce|Peirce]]] wrote me, "and that influence is their meaning for us... In what respects would the world be different if this alternative or that were true? If I can find nothing that would be different, then the alternative has no sense.

The pragmatic method is the "attitude of looking away from first things, principles, 'categories,' supposed necessities; and of looking towards last things, fruits, consequences, facts."

In addition to the pragmatic method, there is a pragmatic conception of truth—"the 'instrumental' view of truth taught so successfully at Chicago, the view that truth in our ideas means their power to 'work,' promulgated so brilliantly at Oxford." [[William James|James]] lists Dewey and F. C. S. Schiller as the primary advocates of this philosophy (which Schiller called "humanism"). Schiller, like James, had attempted to build a compatibilist stance between metaphysics and naturalism.

### Kuhnian revolutions & their precedent in pragmatism

The pragmatist view of science and knowledge, which is as a generic inferential process of schema-building and revision, prefigures Kuhn's:

> The observable process which Schiller and Dewey particularly singled out for generalization is the familiar one by which any individual settles into new opinions. The process here is always the same. The individual has a stock of old opinions already, but he meets a new experience that puts them to a strain. Somebody contradicts them; or in a reflective moment he discovers that they contradict each other; or he hears of facts with which they are incompatible; or desires arise in him which they cease to satisfy. The result is an inward trouble to which his mind till then had been a stranger, and from which he seeks to escape by modifying his previous mass of opinions. He saves as much of it as he can, for in this matter of belief we are all extreme conservatives. So he tries to change first this opinion, and then that (for they resist change very variously), until at last some new idea comes up which he can graft upon the ancient stock with a minimum of disturbance of the latter, some idea that mediates between the stock and the new experience and runs them into one another most felicitously and expediently.

> This new idea is then adopted as the true one. It preserves the older stock of truths with a minimum of modification, stretching them just enough to make them admit the novelty, but conceiving that in ways as familiar as the case leaves possible. An outree explanation, violating all our preconceptions, would never pass for a true account of a novelty. We should scratch round industriously till we found something less eccentric. The most violent revolutions in an individual's beliefs leave most of his old order standing.

> Loyalty to [older truths] is the first principle; for by far the most usual way of handling phenomena so novel that they would make for a serious rearrangement of our preconceptions is to ignore them altogether, or to abuse those who bear witness for them.

A "true" opinion is true insofar as it is useful, and insofar as it reconciles what we know, coherently. Summarizing the positions of Schiller and Dewey's pragmatic truth (the "Oxford" or "Chicago" schools), [[William James|James]] write:

> [Truth] means, they say, nothing but this, _that ideas (which themselves are but parts of our experience) become true just in so far as they help us to get into satisfactory relations with other parts of our experience_, to summarize them and get about among them by conceptual short-cuts instead of following the interminable succession of particular phenomena. Any idea upon which we can ride, so to speak; any idea that will carry us prosperously from any one part of our experience to any other part, linking things satisfactorily, working securely, simplifying, saving labor; is true for just so much, true inn so far forth, true _instrumentally_. 

> A new opinion counts as "true" just in proportion as it gratifies the individual's desire to assimilate the novel in his experience to his beliefs in stock.

Truth, to a pragmatist, is merely [[fit]] with one's existing knowledge, world, ongoing distinction-making, etc. [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], in _Defining a philosophical stance_, argues that philosophers have traditionally (mistakenly) seen themselves as, in an epistemic crisis, eventually revising mistaken beliefs to true ones—when in reality, we "are never in a position to claim that now we possess the truth or now we are fully rational"; the "most that we can claim is that this is the best account which anyone has been able to give so far." In essence, they have lacked a pragmatic understanding of truth.

## Pragmatism as "debugging" language

One frame to view pragmatism's methods is as trying to "get past" potentially arbitrary or obfuscating attributes of our map, in order to properly deal with the territory at-hand. We make a distinction, when faced with a contradiction, _because words conflate specifics_—makes them _conspecific_. The demand for practical, observable consequences is a demand that a distinction in our map be borne out in the territory.

> Concepts for [the pragmatist] are things to come back into experience with, things to make us look for differences.

> Both theories have shown all their consequences and, by the hypothesis we are adopting, these are identical. The pragmatist must consequently say that the two theories, in spite of their different-sounding names, mean exactly the same thing, and that the dispute is purely verbal.

In the language of cogntive schemas, two top-down models are identical insofar as they make identical predictions about bottom-up sense data.
