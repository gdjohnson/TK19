Walter Ong argues that writing: (1) created or entrenched the distinction between literal words and intended meaning (the separation of "interpretation from data"); (2) separates the known from the knower in time and space, thereby (3) removing the writing from an immediate context of reference ("the plenum of existence") which it could or would point to, forcing the writer to find greater descriptive pecularity; (4) it emphasizes definitions, in the wake of this inability to point; (5) and finally, it allows greater ability for intellectual exploration, novelty, etc, because found insights do not need to be shored up (constantly repeated and passed on to prevent their being lost):
> Exploratory thinking is not unknown [in pre-literate cultures], but it is relatively rare, a luxury orality can little afford, for energies must be husbanded to keep on constant call the evanescent knowledge that the ages have so laboriously accumulated. Everybody, or almost everybody, must repeat and repeat and repeat the truths that have come down from the ancestors. Otherwise these truths will escape, and culture will be back on square one, where it started before the ancestors got the truths from their ancestors.
