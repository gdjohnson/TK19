# Information Philosopher
Three axioms of identity:
> Id1. Everything is identical to everything else in some respects.
> Id2. Everything is different from everything else in some other respects.
> Id3. Everything is identical to itself in all respects at each instant of time, but different in some respects from itself at any other time.

And rewritten in philosophy of information terms:
> I1. Any two things have some information in common.
> I2. Any two things have some different information.
> I3.The identity of anything over time is changing because the information in it (and about it) is changing with time.

> The first crucial concept is that characters are entirely defined by, and exist solely in and through their actions: "The truth is, you never have to establish the character. In the first place, there is no such thing as character other than the habitual action, as Mr. Aristotle told us two thousand years ago. It just doesn't exist. Here or in Hollywood or otherwise. They always talk about the character out there in Hollywood, and the fact is, there is no such thing. It doesn't exist. The character is just habitual action. 'Character' is exactly what the person literally does in pursuit of the superobjective, the objective of the scene. The rest doesn't count."

> It is well known that persons protect themselves with all kinds of rationalizations when they have a buried image of themselves which the facts of their status do not support. A person may tell himself many things: that he has not been given a fair chance; that he is not really interested in becoming something else; that the time for showing his mettle has not yet come; that the usual means of realizing his desires are personally or morally distasteful, or require too much dull effort. By means of such defenses, a person saves himself from committing a cardinal social sinâ€‘the sin of defining oneself in terms of a status while lacking the qualifications which an incumbent of that status is supposed to possess.
