[[Richard Roty]], "Freud and Moral Reflection":

> [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] thought of himself as part of the same "decentering" movement of thought to which [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]] and [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] belonged. I think one gets a better idea of the similarity Freud was trying to describe by contrasting a world of natural kinds with a world of machines — a world of Aristotelian substances with a world of homogenous particles combining and disassociating according to universal laws. Think of the claim that "man is a natural kind" not as saying that human beings are at the center of something, but that they have a center, in a way that a machine does not. A substance that exemplifies an Aristotelian natural kind divides into a central essence — one that provides a built-in purpose — and a set of peripheral accidents. But an artifact's formal and final causes may be distinct; the same machine, for example, may be used for many different purposes. A machine's purpose is not built in. If humanity is a natural kind, then perhaps we can find our center and so learn how to live well. But if we are machines, then it is up to us to invent a use for ourselves.

That is, our natural [[teleological language]] draws an equivalence between end and essence. There is a divine project, and an eschatological progression. We are here for a reason; we actualize and fulfill our purpose. Intrinsic teleology or purpose is a perspective of a creator or user. Natural science replaces the teleological view with a mechanized world picture. Classification is revealed to be pragmatic, and our [[pragmatic ontology]] perspectival. Removing this perspective, beings have no purpose, they just "are."

Writing on Freud's view of the ego as "not even a master in his own house":
> Psychological mechanisms will seem more decentering than physiological mechanisms only if one is of a naturally metaphysical turn of mind, insistent on pressing the questions, "But what am I really? What is my true self? What is essential to me?" Descartes and Kant had this sort of mind and so, in our day, do reductionist metaphysicians such as B. F. Skinner and antireductionist champions of "subjectivity" and "phenomenology" such as Thomas Nagel and Richard Wollheim. But the mechanization of nature made protopragmatists of most people, allowing them to shrug off questions of essence. They became accustomed to speaking one sort of language for Baconian purposes of prediction and control and another for purposes of moral reflection.



# Plato's forms

# Conceptual analysis

Conceptual analysis implicitly relies on a reification of concepts, and a belief in essences. From my conversation with Jonathan Livengood:

> a classical account of concepts as having necessary and sufficient criteria in the analytic mode is in some way indistinguishable from the belief in forms or essences insofar as, even if you separate the human concept from the thing in the world, if you advance that the human concept has a low-entropy structure which can be described elegantly and robustly, you're essentially also saying there's a real structure in the world which goes with it. If you can define X, Y, & Z criteria, you have a pattern, and those analyses assume, if you can describe a concept in a non-messy way, as having regularity, then you're granting a certain Platonic reality to the concept; the pattern of regularity is a feature of the world.

# James 1907: Some metaphysical problems pragmatically considered

> Every one uses the old distinction between substance and attribute, enshrined as it is is in the very structure of human language, in the difference between grammatical subject and predicate.

> Nominalists... adopt the opinion that substance is a spurious idea due to our inveterate human trick of turning names into things. Phenomena come in groups—the chalk-group, the wood-group, etc.,—and each group gets its name. The name we then treat as in a way supporting the group of phenomena... as if it lay _behind_ the [phenomenon].

> the phenomenal properties of things, nominalists say, surely do not really inhere in names, and if not in names then they do not inhere in anything. They ADhere, or COhere, rather, _with each other_, and the notion of a substance inaccessible to us, which we think accounts for such cohesion by supporting it, as cement might support pieces of mosaic, must be abandoned. The fact of the bare cohesion itself is all that the notion of the substance signifies. Behind that fact is nothing.

> Few things would seem to have fewer pragmatic consequences for us than substances, cut off as we are from every contact with them.

> I refer to certain disputes about the mystery of the Eucharist. Substance here would appear to have momentous pragmatic value. Since the accidents of the wafer don't change in the Lord's supper, and yet it has become the very body of Christ, it must be that the change is in the substance solely. The bread-substance must have been withdrawn, and the divine substance substituted miraculously without altering the immediate sensible properties. But tho these don't alter, a tremendous difference has been made, no less a one than this, that we who take the sacrament, now feed upon the very substance of divinity. The substance-notion breaks into life, then, with tremendous effect, if once you allow that substances can separate from their accidents, and exchange these latter.

## [[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]] 1986: Principles for a Sociology of Cultural Works

> Like so many others, Foucault succumbs to that form of essentialism or, if one prefers, [[fetish|fetishism]], that is manifested so clearly in other domains, notably in mathematics: one should follow [[Wittgenstein]], who recalls that mathematical truths are not eternal essences born whole from the human brain, but rather are historical productions of a certain type of historical labour undertaken in that peculiar social world called the scientific field.

## [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]: Will to Power

> The “thing-in-itself” nonsensical. If I remove all the relationships, all the “properties,” all the “activities” of a thing, the thing does not remain over; because thingness has only been invented by us owing to the requirements of logic, thus with the aim of defining, communication (to bind together the multiplicity of relationships, properties, activities).
