# Plato's forms

# Conceptual analysis

Conceptual analysis implicitly relies on a reification of concepts, and a belief in essences. From my conversation with Jonathan Livengood:

> a classical account of concepts as having necessary and sufficient criteria in the analytic mode is in some way indistinguishable from the belief in forms or essences insofar as, even if you separate the human concept from the thing in the world, if you advance that the human concept has a low-entropy structure which can be described elegantly and robustly, you're essentially also saying there's a real structure in the world which goes with it. If you can define X, Y, & Z criteria, you have a pattern, and those analyses assume, if you can describe a concept in a non-messy way, as having regularity, then you're granting a certain Platonic reality to the concept; the pattern of regularity is a feature of the world.

# James 1907: Some metaphysical problems pragmatically considered

> Every one uses the old distinction between substance and attribute, enshrined as it is is in the very structure of human language, in the difference between grammatical subject and predicate.

> Nominalists... adopt the opinion that substance is a spurious idea due to our inveterate human trick of turning names into things. Phenomena come in groups—the chalk-group, the wood-group, etc.,—and each group gets its name. The name we then treat as in a way supporting the group of phenomena... as if it lay _behind_ the [phenomenon].

> the phenomenal properties of things, nominalists say, surely do not really inhere in names, and if not in names then they do not inhere in anything. They ADhere, or COhere, rather, _with each other_, and the notion of a substance inaccessible to us, which we think accounts for such cohesion by supporting it, as cement might support pieces of mosaic, must be abandoned. The fact of the bare cohesion itself is all that the notion of the substance signifies. Behind that fact is nothing.

> Few things would seem to have fewer pragmatic consequences for us than substances, cut off as we are from every contact with them.

> I refer to certain disputes about the mystery of the Eucharist. Substance here would appear to have momentous pragmatic value. Since the accidents of the wafer don't change in the Lord's supper, and yet it has become the very body of Christ, it must be that the change is in the substance solely. The bread-substance must have been withdrawn, and the divine substance substituted miraculously without altering the immediate sensible properties. But tho these don't alter, a tremendous difference has been made, no less a one than this, that we who take the sacrament, now feed upon the very substance of divinity. The substance-notion breaks into life, then, with tremendous effect, if once you allow that substances can separate from their accidents, and exchange these latter.

## [[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]] 1986: Principles for a Sociology of Cultural Works

> Like so many others, Foucault succumbs to that form of essentialism or, if one prefers, [[fetish|fetishism]], that is manifested so clearly in other domains, notably in mathematics: one should follow [[Wittgenstein]], who recalls that mathematical truths are not eternal essences born whole from the human brain, but rather are historical productions of a certain type of historical labour undertaken in that peculiar social world called the scientific field.

## [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]: Will to Power

> The “thing-in-itself” nonsensical. If I remove all the relationships, all the “properties,” all the “activities” of a thing, the thing does not remain over; because thingness has only been invented by us owing to the requirements of logic, thus with the aim of defining, communication (to bind together the multiplicity of relationships, properties, activities).
