In _Moral Blindness: The Loss of Sensitivity_, Leonidas Donskis and Zygmunt Bauman reflect on relativism and [[ambiguity]]. "Happy are those epochs that had clear dramas, dreams, and doers of good or evil," Donskis writes. And yet our lives are "permeated by ambivalence; there is no longer any unambiguous social situation, just as there are no more uncompromised actors on the stage of world history." Bauman responds: "How safe and comfortable, cosy and friendly the world would feel if it were monsters and only monsters who perpetrated monstrous deeds."

Games extract pleasure from what Nguyen calls "value clarity": 

> In ordinary life, we have to balance values. First, each of us must balance our own different and competing values, goals, and ends, which is already a difficult enough task. Then, even more torturously, we must balance our interests with the interests of others. But in games, we are permitted a brief respite from the pains of plurality.For a little while, we get to act as though only one thing matters—to lose ourselves in the pursuit of that things. Our values simplify. We need only chase our own goal, in all its simplicity and selfishness—and that goal is usually put in simple, clear, and utterly stark terms.

> In game life, our temporary [[agency]]'s values are usually extremely clear. That clarity is encoded into a game's specification of its goals. The values we take on in games are clearer, easier to apply, and easier to evaluate than our enduring values. 

> Life is a confusing welter of subtle values, in a vast and confusing plurality. Living our lives, as fully sensitive valuing agents, involves making painful judgments, tough decision calls, and agonizing comparisons.

Game play, in other words, involves an "all-consumingly instrumental mode of practical reasoning." The legibility of ranked performances, meanwhile, encourages improvements productivity and performance by establishing common knowledge of relative performance, in turn fostering competition. 

Practically speaking, there's a lot of overlap between embodied value clarity and focus, flow, single-mindedness, decisiveness, moral authority. This is "aggressiveness, in the original Latin sense of the word, as purposefully, decisively, and energetically moving towards a goal" (Henry Taylor 2009). It is also the way that, in near-death experiences, time slows down.

# Value clarity in non-gamic mediums

Value clarity is common in film and television, as well as [[sports]] and e-sports. Twitch streams of gamers are incredibly common, and the job of "pure instrumentalism," of a hammer that knows it's a hammer, is a large part of the appeal.

Alexandra Molotkow, in "An Erotics of Hypochondria," suggests that obsession serves to create value clarity:
> Crushes replaced disease in the same obsessive apparatus, which tends to kick into gear when life feels relatively chaotic. Both limerence and hypochondria have tremendous organizational power, lining up all your cares under one major concern.

By extension, the value clarity acts as a [[scapegoat]]: 
> "The kinds of stories that produce hypochondria may be thought of as stories that convert general anxiety temporarily into fear of a particular object," Belling writes.

We can argue a kind of quantified value clarity underlies the appeal of money-oriented values systems:

> [10:12 AM] suspended reason: wonder if Nguyen talks at all about money/optimizing for money as values clarity/accidental gamification
> [10:13 AM] suspended reason: Thinking of that [[Douglas Adams]] quote about people organizing their lives around little green bills
> [10:14 AM] suspended reason: obviously there are practical reasons to care about money, but there also seems to be a stage of [[fetish]], where people have just made it their values system and it's now an ends rather than means

## Spilled Reality: Value Clarity 2.0

So, people on the server (including myself) have gotten a lot of mileage out of [[C Thi Nguyen]]’s “value clarity” concept. Basically, as I understand it, Nguyen thinks games work by creating an artificial value clarity for their players—that is, an artificially narrow set of priorities for the player to optimize, like points or kills. By contrast, real life is a welter of conflicting, complex goals and values.

The benefit to value clarity is that it’s motivating—it feels _good_ to know you’re objectively maxing out character stats, whereas “being a good person” is harder, more subjective, permeated by self-doubt. The cost of value clarity is, well, its impoverishment—it forgets about or ignores important things we care about (but don’t include in our calculus).

> In ordinary life, we have to balance values. First, each of us must balance our own different and competing values, goals, and ends, which is already a difficult enough task. Then, even more torturously, we must balance our interests with the interests of others. But in games, we are permitted a brief respite from the pains of plurality. For a little while, we get to act as though only one thing matters—to lose ourselves in the pursuit of that things. Our values simplify. We need only chase our own goal, in all its simplicity and selfishness—and that goal is usually put in simple, clear, and utterly stark terms.

This isn’t a problem if we’re playing board games, which can be low-stakes, productive exercises in a occupying an alternate form of agency. (That is, an alternate set of affordances, desires, constraints, etc.) But Nguyen think value clarity becomes a problem when it imposes itself on the real world—say, Amazon gamifying warehouse employees, or Disney Resorts gamify housekeeping. Worker well-being, and a ton of other “holistic” values go out the window. (What these holistic values are, Nguyen doesn’t really specify or explicate—at least in the writing of his I’ve read.) So, housekeepers lose their sense of dignity-in-labor, as they cease to take pride in work itself— with all the holistic, conflicting values that must be managed in performing such work—and start to care only about racking up points in the gamified system. Workers become cut-throat competitive and, turned against one another, each seek to gain diminishing marginal advantages with greater and greater self-sacrifices—creating a treadmill effect which all their colleagues must keep up with.

The first problem I have with this concept, and corresponding argument, I’ve already implied with my tone, which is a response, ultimately, to a distaste for Nguyen’s tone. I’m not sure I believe there’s some beautiful, rich, holistic set of values that the housekeepers used to walk around with, taking pride in their work, which was suddenly destroyed because Disney Resorts assigned points for how many towels they washed. I _do_ think that gamification formalizes certain values, and that this formalization—this [[surrogation]]—is necessarily lossy, excluding values that the game designers (1) didn’t think of (2) couldn’t think how to quantitatively track, while also (by instituting quantitative surrogates for many qualitative assessments) impoverishing some of their evaluative capacities. At the same time, let’s be clear, _this is already how incentive structures work_. When you step into a new job, you’re walking into an incentive structure that _already_ cares about certain things and not others. When you step into a new job, you’re walking into an incentive structure which _already_ diverges from your own priorities, and not just that, which diverges from the _employer’s_ priorities, because even though “being efficient” is a value the employer cares about, “looking efficient” is the only thing the employer can monitor.

Which brings me to the second bone to pick, which is that “value clarity,” is less, in my book, a question of _games_, and more a matter of _[[framing]]_. A framework “just is” the reduction of complexity into a tractable set of priorities. An [[ideology]] “just is” a hammer that looks out and only sees nails: ontologically, the world has been transformed by its single-minded purpose. The entire point is simplification, because by simplifying priorities, you essentially reduce constraints, and can better max out the priorities included in the framework. In my response to [[Crispy Chicken]]'s “[Stupid Leverage](https://spilledreality.tumblr.com/post/664965322480254976/stupid-leverage),” I write:

> it’s usually a bad idea to spend 10x as capital, energy, or time to be .001% less exploitable. Which is what optimizing for only one single trait virtually demands. If I want to make my house retain heat better, in winter, I can pretty easily and cheaply add insulation to the walls and ceilings. I can pretty easily and cheaply seal up window cracks. This is the low-hanging fruit. Once it’s gone, I have to take more drastic, expensive, time-consuming measures. I will have to sacrifice _enormously_ on fronts like aesthetics, comfort, and affordability. And I will face diminishing returns for all my effort.

Which is to say that I agree with Nguyen, that value clarity is both tempting and dangerous. I just think it’s a much bigger phenomenon, more complicated phenomenon than he presents.

In _Moral Blindness: The Loss of Sensitivity_, [[Leonidas Donskis]] and [[Zygmunt Bauman]] reflect on relativism and ambiguity. “Happy are those epochs that had clear dramas, dreams, and doers of good or evil,” Donskis writes. And yet our lives are “permeated by ambivalence; there is no longer any unambiguous social situation, just as there are no more uncompromised actors on the stage of world history.” Bauman responds: “How safe and comfortable, cosy and friendly the world would feel if it were monsters and only monsters who perpetrated monstrous deeds.”

How amusing—that to Donskis and Bauman, we _used_ to have value clarity, but now we have a complex welter. Whereas to Nguyen, the threat is almost the opposite. Or rather, we’ve come back around and reinvented ideology via the incentive structure. Which is what ideology always was, to begin with. Certain behaviors are seen as advancing group interests, and certain behaviors are seen to set them back, and ideology guides you to choose the former, even though this is at best, a rough heuristic for what _actually_ advances group interests.

Value clarity is also a huge draw of narrative fiction. In [[Jake Naviasky|Simpolism]]’s “[A Dialogue about Evangelion](https://href.li/?https://listed.to/@simpolism/22410/a-dialogue-on-evangelion),” the interlocutor I, frustrated by the lack of determinacy and resolution in [[_Neon Genesis Evangelion_]], writes:

> I: If I were to own up to it, I’d call it “escapism”. I want the show to feel like a different world of its own, where things make sense. And I guess that’s because, to some extent, the rest of my life might not make sense.

> A: What does it mean when you say that the rest of your life doesn’t make sense?

> I: Oh, it’s just that, I deal with a lot of unexpected events at work, and the world seems like it’s in such a crazy place right now, with all sorts of political and cultural events happening every day. It feels like a relief to enter into a world where things do make sense, and I think that’s what I expect to receive from TV when I watch it.

We can also argue a kind of quantified value clarity underlies the appeal of money-oriented values systems: optimizing your life around accumulating money is a real thing people do. Ditto with symbolic capital and body-building. Which is to say that quantification and gamification aren’t actually necessary for value clarity—they help, because they create an objective, and thus legible and/or socially agreed-upon measurement. (Leading to round-number fetish.) But people give themselves over to obsession constantly—to art, to craft, to reputation—at the cost of family, happiness, and ethics. Single-mindedness is somewhat unusual, but selection effects guarantee that the single-minded dominate and outcompete those with a “holistic” welter of priorities. Sam Fussell, on his lifting days: “I became a bodybuilder as a means of becoming a caricature. The inflated cartoon I became relieved me from the responsibility of being human.”

There’s a different level of value clarity—not from the perspective of an individual, balancing parts of his life, but from the perspective of a task—where certain aspects of “doing a good job” are pulled out an incentivized, while others are not. But this, in my book, is a problem of incentive structures and coordination broadly—of underspecification, letter vs. spirit, opticratics, of free-riders and monitoring and oversight. It is not a matter of “games,” or the pernicious “gamification,” which strikes me more as a political and aesthetic critique than a coherent philosophical one.

> because [[bodybuilding]]/powerlifting is so numbers-oriented, among other things, part of that reality is remember how it first felt to bench press 315 (three wheels!), to bench press 405 (four wheels!), to squat 500 (five wheels!), to deadlift 500 (five wheels!). Every single one of those lifts took years (for me) to build up to. They were a kind of concrete sanctification of what I was doing (that pleasure comes from pain, that dreams come true through sheer industry and endless repetition with some minor variation).

## Muscle

> From exercise to exercise I'd go, feeling as if I were driving a car on a dark, wet night in the city. Suddenly, the stoplight just ahead turns green, the next one green, and green again. You don't need to brake for even one light. All you see is the road before you. You're not quite sure why, but you're going at the right speed at the right place and time. You take a quick look at the speedometer. Just to memorize the reading. But there's no need. Just keep it going, another light, another block, another weight, another exercise. Green, green, green.

> The gym was the one place I had control. I didn't have to speak. I didn't have to listen. I just had to push or pull. It was so much simpler, so much satisfying than life outside. I regulated everything, from the number of exercises I performed each workout to the amount of weight I used for each exercise, from the number of reps per set to the number of sets per body part. It beat the street. It beat my girlfriend. It beat my family. I didn't have to think. I didn't have to care. I didn't have to feel. I simply had to lift.

> An article I read haunted me. The piece had reported Schwarzenegger's happiness in signing a new movie contract. In it, Arnold said, "Arnold is back where he belongs, on top." I longed for that conviction, the ease and peace of mind that would come from the simplistic belief that there is a top and a bottom in this world. Top and bottom, black and white, good and evil, positive and negative, big and small, I retreated into the narrow world of dichotomy. I no longer had questions, only solutions, and they all pointed to the weight room.

> I became a bodybuilder as a means of becoming a caricature. The inflated cartoon I became relieved me from the responsibility of being human.
