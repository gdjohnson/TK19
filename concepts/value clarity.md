In _Moral Blindness: The Loss of Sensitivity_, Leonidas Donskis and Zygmunt Bauman reflect on relativism and [[ambiguity]]. "Happy are those epochs that had clear dramas, dreams, and doers of good or evil," Donskis writes. And yet our lives are "permeated by ambivalence; there is no longer any unambiguous social situation, just as there are no more uncompromised actors on the stage of world history." Bauman responds: "How safe and comfortable, cosy and friendly the world would feel if it were monsters and only monsters who perpetrated monstrous deeds."

Games extract pleasure from what Nguyen calls "value clarity": 

> In ordinary life, we have to balance values. First, each of us must balance our own different and competing values, goals, and ends, which is already a difficult enough task. Then, even more torturously, we must balance our interests with the interests of others. But in games, we are permitted a brief respite from the pains of plurality.For a little while, we get to act as though only one thing matters—to lose ourselves in the pursuit of that things. Our values simplify. We need only chase our own goal, in all its simplicity and selfishness—and that goal is usually put in simple, clear, and utterly stark terms.

> In game life, our temporary [[agency]]'s values are usually extremely clear. That clarity is encoded into a game's specification of its goals. The values we take on in games are clearer, easier to apply, and easier to evaluate than our enduring values. 

> Life is a confusing welter of subtle values, in a vast and confusing plurality. Living our lives, as fully sensitive valuing agents, involves making painful judgments, tough decision calls, and agonizing comparisons.

Game play, in other words, involves an "all-consumingly instrumental mode of practical reasoning." The legibility of ranked performances, meanwhile, encourages improvements productivity and performance by establishing common knowledge of relative performance, in turn fostering competition. 

Practically speaking, there's a lot of overlap between embodied value clarity and focus, flow, single-mindedness, decisiveness, moral authority. This is "aggressiveness, in the original Latin sense of the word, as purposefully, decisively, and energetically moving towards a goal" (Henry Taylor 2009). It is also the way that, in near-death experiences, time slows down.

# Value clarity in non-gamic mediums

Value clarity is common in film and television, as well as [[sports]] and e-sports. Twitch streams of gamers are incredibly common, and the job of "pure instrumentalism," of a hammer that knows it's a hammer, is a large part of the appeal.

In Simpolism's "A Dialogue about Evangelion," the interlocutor I, frustrated by the lack of determinacy and resolution in _Neon Genesis Evangelion_, writes:

> I: If I were to own up to it, I'd call it "escapism". I want the show to feel like a different world of its own, where things make sense. And I guess that's because, to some extent, the rest of my life might not make sense.

> A: What does it mean when you say that the rest of your life doesn't make sense?

> I: Oh, it's just that, I deal with a lot of unexpected events at work, and the world seems like it's in such a crazy place right now, with all sorts of political and cultural events happening every day. It feels like a relief to enter into a world where things do make sense, and I think that's what I expect to receive from TV when I watch it.


We can argue a kind of quantified value clarity underlies the appeal of money-oriented values systems:

> [10:12 AM] suspended reason: wonder if Nguyen talks at all about money/optimizing for money as values clarity/accidental gamification
> [10:13 AM] suspended reason: Thinking of that Douglas Adams quote about people organizing their lives around little green bills
> [10:14 AM] suspended reason: obviously there are practical reasons to care about money, but there also seems to be a stage of [[fetish]], where people have just made it their values system and it's now an ends rather than means

## 2014 Interview with Dr. Michael Joyner

> because [[bodybuilding]]/powerlifting is so numbers-oriented, among other things, part of that reality is remember how it first felt to bench press 315 (three wheels!), to bench press 405 (four wheels!), to squat 500 (five wheels!), to deadlift 500 (five wheels!). Every single one of those lifts took years (for me) to build up to. They were a kind of concrete sanctification of what I was doing (that pleasure comes from pain, that dreams come true through sheer industry and endless repetition with some minor variation).

## Muscle

> From exercise to exercise I'd go, feeling as if I were driving a car on a dark, wet night in the city. Suddenly, the stoplight just ahead turns green, the next one green, and green again. You don't need to brake for even one light. All you see is the road before you. You're not quite sure why, but you're going at the right speed at the right place and time. You take a quick look at the speedometer. Just to memorize the reading. But there's no need. Just keep it going, another light, another block, another weight, another exercise. Green, green, green.

> The gym was the one place I had control. I didn't have to speak. I didn't have to listen. I just had to push or pull. It was so much simpler, so much satisfying than life outside. I regulated everything, from the number of exercises I performed each workout to the amount of weight I used for each exercise, from the number of reps per set to the number of sets per body part. It beat the street. It beat my girlfriend. It beat my family. I didn't have to think. I didn't have to care. I didn't have to feel. I simply had to lift.

> An article I read haunted me. The piece had reported Schwarzenegger's happiness in signing a new movie contract. In it, Arnold said, "Arnold is back where he belongs, on top." I longed for that conviction, the ease and peace of mind that would come from the simplistic belief that there is a top and a bottom in this world. Top and bottom, black and white, good and evil, positive and negative, big and small, I retreated into the narrow world of dichotomy. I no longer had questions, only solutions, and they all pointed to the weight room.

> I became a bodybuilder as a means of becoming a caricature. The inflated cartoon I became relieved me from the responsibility of being human.
