## Chalmers: Strong & Weak Emergence

__strong emergence__: the "truths concerning [a high-level] phenomenon are not _deducible_ even in principle from truths in the low-evel domain"; the typical meaning in philosophical contexts.

__weak emergence__: the "truths concerning [a high-level] phenomenon are _unexpected_ given the principles governing the low-level domain"; the typical meaning in scientific and complexity studies contexts.

Strong emergence (for Chalmers, the only plausible candidate in our world is consciousness) has radical implications for our natural laws, implying their incompleteness; weak emergence does not. Weak emergence is more an observer-based classification with a "something for nothing attitude," in which complexity that is _interesting_ and _surprising_ arises from ostensible simplicityâ€”in other words, the behavior is _unpredictable_.
