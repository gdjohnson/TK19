Honor cultures (or "shame cultures") are defined in large part by their preoccupation and protection of personal and group reputation. Others' perceptions are non-trivial in honor cultures, and perceived insults or sleights are taken seriously. Handling these disputes honorably requires handling them personally and autonomously, rather than reporting to some higher authority; indeed, "snitching" is deeply taboo. Dominant values in honor cultures include courage, self-sufficiency, loyalty, and solidarity between kin.

Honor culture is still alive today in some parts of black urban culture, in gangs and turfwar. Historically and multiculturally it is a more common system than the dignity culture of WEIRD society.

Features of honor culture:
1. strong concern for, and oversight of, reputation
2. strong preferential treatment of ingroup
3, strong group identity & role

In dignity cultures, there is an "authentic" self and a situational (e.g. job, family) self. In honor cultures, the group role is a dominant and grounding source of identity. Members typically have a stable group role which forms the basis for what is perceived subjectively and socially as one's "true" identity. Dignity cultures view this internalization of structure as "false consciousness," the false belief in their mask as face (cf. [[persona]]). 

Peter Berger on honor:

> Both honor and dignity are concepts that bridge self and society. [...] The concept of honor implies that identity is essentially, or at least importantly, linked to institutional roles. The modern concept of dignity, by contrast, implies that identity is essentially independent of institutional roles. [...] In a world of honor, the individual discovers his true identity in his roles, and to turn away from the roles is to turn away from himself – in "false consciousness," one is tempted to add. In a world of dignity, the individual can only discover his true identity by emancipating himself from his socially imposed roles – the latter are only [[persona|masks]], entangling him in illusion, "alienation" and "bad faith." [...] In a world of honor, identity is firmly linked to the past through the reiterated performance of prototypical acts. In a world of dignity, history is the succession of mystification from which the individual must free himself to attain "authenticity."

## Dueling and virtue: in conversation at the Daily Stoic

> The practice offered a lot of social benefits, including what I was alluding to earlier – the greater egalitarianism of honor communities. The philosopher Anthony Appiah has written about this in his book The Honor Code.  Duels were one of the things that served to maintain the egalitarian codes of an honor group.  Early opponents of the duel, such as Francis Bacon and Cardinal Richelieu, opposed dueling precisely on these grounds.  Bacon wanted to expand the power of the monarchy and further distinguish ranks among gentlemen. The equalizing function of duels was an obstacle to the kind of hierarchy he wanted to create.

Deaths were far rarer than typically portrayed, the exception rather than the rule:

> Dueling [[ritual|rituals]] were designed to testify to the honor of the combatants while at the same time minimizing the risk of death or injury. The combatants would use inaccurate pistols and swords that were modified to reduce the harm they would cause.  And most challenges were resolved without fighting of any kind. According to the sociologist Randall Collins, the point of the duel was more “to demonstrate one’s status-group membership than to establish dominance over one’s opponent.” So “it was less important to win than to display courage.”  As long as you showed up and showed some heart, you could leave the duel with honor.

(_See the duel in Barry Lyndon: the family has provided the pair with tampered pistols that will prevent any deaths among the combatants._)

Honor culture provides a framework for positive, and not just negational, virtue than rights cultures lack:

> Rights-based moralities mostly tell us what not to do. Don’t violate someone else’s rights. Don’t infringe on their autonomy.  But they lack a theoretical and, more importantly, a motivational structure to encourage acts of positive virtue.

Sommers plays up the role of incentivized virtue and courage in honor culture—

> We need deep internalized incentives – what evolutionary biologists and behavioral economists have called “commitment devices” – to overcome our natural impulse toward comfort and safety. Honor frameworks offer a rich tapestry of codes and incentives to counteract this impulse. Honor cultures tend to attach great value to acts of courage that benefit the group – and they have whole set of norms that encourage bravery and discourage being a coward.  If you’re a coward in an honor culture, your status goes down. So honor-oriented values are tremendously effective for motivating acts of positive virtue.

But the basic mechanism of a prestige economy, based on group-benefitting acctions, holds through historical honor and contemporary dignity or rights cultures. Perhaps what is unique about honor cultures is their emphasis on courage, but certainly not on group incentivation of prosocial behavior. 

Especially strangely, Sommers sees the disappearance of shame from our contemporary moral landscape:

> You can see the effects of shame’s disappearance from our moral vocabulary. To this day, virtually no one in the financial industry has taken responsibility for their role in the 2008 banking crisis that sent the economy into near depression.  And that shamelessness persisted long after the collapse. Senior executives at banks were bailed out by the government and still received bonuses in the millions. When the public expressed their outrage, the executives complained that they were being singled out, vilified, all part of a cynical attempt to generate “class warfare.”  Yes, honor cultures probably rely too much on shame, but our alternative is this epidemic of shamelessness.
