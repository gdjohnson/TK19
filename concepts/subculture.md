[[Sam Fussell]], _Muscle_:

> That's when it hit me. Bad theater. Every word they uttered, every move they made seemed rehearesed—as rehearsed, in fact, as any performance I'd ever seen on stage. That explained the pregnant pauses before delivering the lines I knew so well from the magazines. Lines like "You gotta stay hungry," or "You work hard, good things will happen." Much of being a bodybuilder, I gathered, meant playing at being a bodybuilder.

> [Fellow builder] Mousie: "Look, you be a builder, you _carry_ yo'self like a builder." [...] it was out on Fifty-second and Fifty-third that Mousie and Sweepea taught me "the Walk," that peculiar weight-lifters' waddle. 

On the [[knowledge economies|intellectual dark matter]]of [[fields]] (cf. Bourdieu on gossip):

> As with steroids, the magazines avoided altogether the subject, since it included the disturbing matter of shaving the legs. But I gathered from Mousie and Sweepea that I would need a number of blades. So I bought my "Lady Bics," ten of them, retreated to the bunker and ran the bathwater.

Hossenfelder, *Aeon*: What I learned as a hired consultant to autodidact physicists:
> Sociologists have long tried and failed to draw a line between science and pseudoscience. In physics, though, that ‘demarcation problem’ is a non-problem, solved by the pragmatic observation that we can reliably tell an outsider when we see one. During a decade of education, we physicists learn more than the tools of the trade; we also learn the walk and talk of the community, shared through countless seminars and conferences, meetings, lectures and papers. After exchanging a few sentences, we can tell if you’re one of us. You can’t fake our community slang any more than you can fake a local accent in a foreign country.

Reason 2018, "Oscillation/Fashion":
> Moreover, fashionability, or cool, or style, acts as a passphrase, a shift key, a phase shift, a valuable [[surrogation|proxy]] for speaker identity which then allows the speaker to communicate complexly, reflexively, with reference to self and modified by self. _It is reliable because of the intense difficulty of faking fashion, which requires so much insider knowledge that any successful impostor is arguably no longer a fake_. There’s a reason it’s tough to get into Berghain. Consider, by way of another example, the way true upperclass belonging, or highbrow aesthetic taste, is so impossible to convincingly fake for those outside the caste. So much of fashion is unquantified, subconscious, and ambiently soft that we are not even explicitly aware of the class and taste signals we send, or what alternative signals we might send to signal an alternative identity, and yet we send them constantly, through word choice, attitude, posture, interest, palette, reference, familiarity.
