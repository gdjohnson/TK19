"All layers interact; no economy is separate from the others." (Perry 2016: Inequalities)

To [[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]], the objective distances and relations between people are, first and foremost, characterized by

> the relations between positions occupied within the distributions of the resources which are or may become active, effective, like aces in a game of cards, in the competition for the appropriation of scarce goods of which this social universe is the site. According to my empirical investigations, these fundamental powers are economic capital (in its different forms), cultural capital, social capital, and symbolic capital, which is the form that the various species of capital assume when they are perceived and recognized as legitimate. Thus agents are distributed in the overall social space, in the first dimension, according to the overall volume of capital they possess and, in the second dimension, according to the structure of their capital, that is, the relative weight of the different species of capital, economic and cultural, in the total volume of their assets.

# Symbolic Capital

## Bird & Smith 2005: Signaling Theory, Strategic Interaction, and Symbolic Capital

The social world is ruled by two facts: One is relative opacity, i.e. incomplete information. The other is the accompaniment of differential benefits to cooperation _with the right people_ versus the wrong people. Thus arises a necessity of gathering information to forge quality alliances or embark on coordinated efforts: 

> By paying attention to the problem of how credibility is maintained when individuals have to make interdependent decisions (about mates, alliances, conflict, and trust) based on incomplete information, [[signaling theory]] provides a new interpretation of such symbolic performance as aesthetic elaboration, initiation rites, ethnic boundaries, ceremonial feasting, wealth circulation, conspicuous consumption, monumental architecture, religious commitment, and the individually costly provisioning of collective goods.

### Origins of symbolic capital

The concept of symbolic capital, or of the [[status|prestige]] economy, constitutes an explanation that locates in [[signaling theory]] a basis for human culture. Veblen, Mauss, and [[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]] comprise a 20th C sociological trajectory theorizing an exchange between individuals of literal for symbolic capital, where "the most generous or self-sacificial individuals gain higher [[status|prestige]], and the recipients or observers gain material benefit at the expense of their own [[status|prestige]]."

#### Veblen's theory of the leisure class

Veblen advanced a theory of the leisure class as engaged in wasteful consumption and conspicuous leisure. Veblen:

> If, in addition to showing that the wearer can afford to consume freely and uneconomically, it can also be shown in the same stroke that he or she is not under the necessity of earning a livelihood, the evidence of social worth is enhanced in a very considerable degree.

His theories noted that such signals were most important when individuals wealth or social [[status]] was "not widely known or could be unreliable," explaining why new money (the neouveau riche) engaged in more showy consumption practices than old money, whose wealth was ostensibly "already common knowledge." These theories of wasteful, uneconomical signaling were advanced as a counter to classical economic theory's view that individual and group interests were in sync, and that individuals acted purely to optimize material wealth.

#### Mauss's conspicuous generosity

Mauss focused on precapitalist generosity, such as potlatch, concluding that "conspicuous giving was based on a superstructural economy of [[status|prestige]]." Mauss:

> Nowhere else is the [[status|prestige]] of an individual as closely bound up with expenditure... Consumption and destruction are virtually unlimited... The rich man who shows his wealth by spending recklessly is the man who wins [[status|prestige]].

But whereas Veblen and [[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]] framed these practices in terms of individual benefit (the accumulation of regard, [[status|prestige]], or symbolic capital) Mauss saw them as being in the service of "the structural integration of culture."

#### [[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]]'s Outline of a Theory of Practice

Bird & Smith:

> [[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]] argues that the accumulation of symbolic capital is just as "rational" as the accumulation of economic capital, particularly since such capital may be freely converted from one form to another, ultimately in order to gain advantages in the form of additional wealth, power, allies, and marriage partners.

[[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]], _Distinction_:

> The objects endowed with the greatest distinctive power are those which most clearly attest the quality of the appropriation, and therefore the quality of their owner, because their possession requires time and capacities which, requiring a long investment of time, like pictorial or musical culture, **cannot be acquired in haste or by [[surrogation|proxy]],** and which therefore appear as the surest indications of the quality of the person. This explains the importance which the pursuit of distinction attaches to all those activities which, like artistic consumption, demand pure, **pointless expenditure, especially of the rarest and most precious thing of all... namely time.**

### Importing costly-signaling theory

_See [[Signaling Theory]] for main entry._

Bird & Smith:

> there are two elements missing from these early formulations... First, costliness is not always necessary to guarantee signal value. Some signals maintain symbolic value because they are indexically related to that which they signify: **they are simply impossible to fake.** For example, the head flattening practiced by some Native American tribes to distinguish the free-born from slaves was a reliable signal not because of its cost but because it could be performed only for children on the initiative of free-born parents. Second, while [[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]]'s notion of symbolic capital explains how costs ensure honesty, none of these accounts of [[signaling theory]] explain why an honest display confers [[status|prestige]]. Why would it be to the benefit of others to defer to one who signals his or her social or economic superiority—in other words, why tolerate inequality?

Evolutionary ecological theories of costly signaling hold that honest signals provide information to observers, improving their decision-making abilities. Moreover, deference is a way of gaining access to, and forging alliances with, high-capability members of a group.

However, making decisions based on _dishonest_ signals puts one at a disadvantage (differential benefit). Thus, to take advantage of the informational benefits of honest signals, organisms must have a way of sorting them from dishonest signals. Honest signals must be _hard or difficult to fake_, and a large subset of hard-to-fake signals is the _costly signal_, where the marginal cost of a display, for organisms which possess a desired trait, is significantly lower than the cost of the same display for organisms lacking that trait. Giving away wealth, for instance, has asymmetrical marginal cost by definition; a charitable donation or bottle service at a club has very different fitness costs for a very wealth versus very poor person. For this reason, reckless expenditure is often taken as a reliable sign of wealth, the very mechanism which Anna Sorokin (Anna "Delvey") used to "swindle N.Y.'s elite" (_New York Times_, 4/25/19) out of almost a quarter million dollars, establishing credibility in her fake identity as "heiress" primarily by giving away large quantities of cash.

## Suttles 1960: Affinal Ties, Subsistence, and [[status|Prestige]]

*On the conversion of resources into wealth into [[status|prestige]]:*

> Since wealth is indirectly or directly obtainable through food, then inequalities in food production will be translated into inequalities in wealth. If one community over a period of several years were to produce more food than its neighbors, it might come to have a greater part of the society’s wealth. Under such circumstances the less productive communities might become unable to give wealth back in exchange for further gifts of food from the more productive one. If amassing wealth were an end in itself the process of sharing surplus food might thus break down. But wealth, in the native view, is only a means to high [[status]] achieved through the giving of it. And so the community that has converted its surplus food into wealth and now has a surplus of wealth gets rid of its wealth by giving it away at a potlatch. And this, though the participants need not be conscious of it, by “restoring the purchasing power” of the other communities, enables the whole process to continue. The potlatchers have converted their surplus wealth into high [[status]]. High [[status]] in turn enables the potlatchers to establish wider ties, make better marriages with more distant villages, and thus extend the process farther.

# Cultural Capital

## [[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]]

### Sociology is a Martial Art

> Today, increasingly, the reproduction of irregularities is achieved more and more through the transmission of cultural capital.

# Reason 2020: El morada

> Who one works with, where one writes, subsumes what is written or produced as the common barometer of quality, in part because first-principle evaluation proves time-consuming, there is too much out there; in part because associative thinking is a human universal. «The art trader is not just the agent who gives the work a commercial value by bringing it into market; he is not just the representative, the impresario, who ‘defends the authors he loves’. He is the person who can proclaim the value of the author he defends (cf. the fiction of the catalogue or blurb) and above all ‘invests his [[status|prestige]]’ in the author’s cause, acting as a ‘symbolic banker’ who offers as security all the symbolic capital he has accumulated (which he is liable to forfeit if he backs a ‘loser’).»74 Which is to say it’s not that a curator or critic or any other vested consecrator is cynically promoting (thus tying their fate to) the artists they champion primarily in order to accumulate cultural capital.

## Examples

Franzen, _Freedom_:

> The Bob Dylan documentary _Don't Look Back_ was such a touchstone for both Richard and Walter that Patty eventually rented it and watched it with Walter, one night when the kids were little, so that she could see the famous scene in which Dylan outshone and humiliated the singer Donovan at a party for cool people in London, purely for the pleasure of being an asshole. Though Walter felt sorry for Donovan—and what's more, felt bad about himself for not wanting to be more like Dylan and less like Donovan—Patty found the scene thrilling. The breathtaking nakedness of Dylan's competitiveness! Her feeling was: Let's face it, victory was sweet.

> it was bad enough to be treated with such consistent frostiness by sexy girls, but even worse was Walter's suspicion—confessed to Patty in the years when they'd kept no secrets from each other—that he was at root no different than any of those girls: that he, too, was a kind of parasite on Richard, trying to feel cooler and better about himself by means of his unique connection to him.

> It happened that Molly's mother was a longtime Arts editor at the _New York Times_, a fact that may explain why the Traumatics, despite record sales in the low four digits and audiences in the high two digits, had received several full write-ups in the _Times_ ("Consistently Original, Perennially Unheard Of," "Undaunted by Indifference, the Traumatics Soldier On") plus brief review of each of their records after _In Case You Hadn't Noticed_. Coincidentally or not, _Insanely Happy_—their first record without Molly and, as it turned out, their last—was ignored not only by the _Times_ but even by the free weekly city papers that had long been a bastion of Traumatic support. What had happened, as Richard theorized over an early supper with Walter and Patty when the band dragged itself through the Twin Cities yet again, was that he'd been buying press attention on credit all along, without realizing it, and that the press had finally concluded that familiarity with the Traumatics was never going to be necessary to anyone's cultural literacy or street credibility, and so there was no reason to extend him further credit.

[[Sam Fussell]], _Muscle_, comparing himself to his friends in finance:

> Their money was my muscles. Both of us were stocking and hoarding our respective units of worth, and trumpeting ourselves for our skill in attaining it. We couldn't live without the idea of a credit rating. (_See also [[valueClarity]]._)

And from an NPR interview on _Fresh Air_: "two incremental self-measures of worth"


# Capital's expression in language (signaling)

_See also [[Signaling Theory]] and [[Conversation]]._

> utterances are not only (save in exceptional circumstances) signs to be understood and deciphered; they are also _signs of wealth_, intended to be evaluated and appreciated, and _signs of authority_, intended to be believed and obeyed. Quite apart from the literary (and especially poetic) uses of language, it is rare in everyday life for language to function as a pure instrument of communication. The pursuit of maximum informative efficiency is only exceptionally the exclusive goal of linguistic production and the distinctly instrumental use of language which it implies generally clashes with the often unconscious pursuit of symbolic profit.
