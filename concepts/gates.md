In New York, when I commuted in the mornings, I remember how 15 seconds late could turn into 15 minutes, the result of missing a train on a schedule.

All that is analogue, continuous, becomes digital, discrete. You can speed ahead only to get caught at a red light, and the car you just passed catches up to you. There was never any getting past it. This is the lesson Kenobi learns, in the reactor cores of Naboo: a half-meter, a half-second, is the difference between life and death. A series of gates separates him and his master, battling the enemy on the other side. He is a hair too late; the laser gate actives in front of him; he watches his master die.

This is the meaning of a tipping point; this is the study of catastrophe theory. A single straw breaks the camel's back. In an admissions or hiring process, miniscule differences combine with a cutoff; a thin sliver of difference in inputs becomes a chasm in outputs. A candidate loses by a hair on his head; the world changes; the world spins.

Catastrophe theory: a branch of bifurcation theory, itself a subset of dynamical systems theory, which analyzes how minor changes in circumstance can cause dramatic shift in the system's behavior, e.g. setting off a mudslide. (See [[The Garden of Forking Paths]])
