Franzen, _Freedom_:
> In Washington people literally talk about how many feet away from John Kerry’s house their own house is. The neighborhoods are all so blah, the only thing that turns people on is proximity to power. It’s a total fetish culture. People get this kind of orgasmic shiver when they tell you they sat next to Paul Wolfowitz at a concert or got invited to Grover Norquist’s breakfast. Everybody’s obsessing 24/7, trying to position themselves in relation to power.

Andrea Fraser, “Toward a Reflexive Existence":
> The greatest and most damning intellectual and political failure of the Left may be the failure to recognize cultural capital not only as a socially effective form of power but also as a form of domination, not only substantively, in its particular forms, but also structurally and relationally, in its distributions and through the social differences and hierarchies that it articulates and performs. While the myopic focus on the 1% may be effective symbolically, it not only lets the remaining 99% off the hook but also reduces social power to economic wealth lodged in a single, one-dimensional dominant class. Like many Marxist traditions, in [[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]]'s estimation, such representations provide a “revolutionary theory with a purely external usage, which questions all powers save for that which intellectuals wield”—cultural [[capital]]—and thus allow intellectuals to be “very critical without themselves being concerned by their critique.” 

# Guddemi 2006: "Breaking the Concept of Power":

> On the subject of power, [[Gregory Bateson]] was outspoken. Power was an epistemological mistake, a false metaphor. It was, like energy, an improper concept for the living world, imported from the world of physics, the world of forces and impacts. It was a self-validating cultural myth, based on a fiction of unilateral control.In fact, control of this kind was not possible, because any system in which control is attempted is structured in circular systems of feedback. Even the biggest dictators have to calibrate their actions to what they can find out about the public’s opinion, as Bateson—who sided very strongly with the Allies during World War II—often noted with respect to Goebbel.

> Bateson was very interested in nontransitive comparisons, possibly because they subvert the commonsense transitivity of hierarchy and dominance which in many cases we read into the data because of our expectations. We rank sports teams for a winner at the end of the season, yet this final ranking aggregates a lot of non-transitivity in the meantime, in which the Angels beat the Braves, the Braves beat the Cardinals, and yet the Cardinals beat the Angels.

> ...as Bateson put it in words a Wittgenstein might have said, power is a “vasttangle of interlocking notions,” none of which give credence to any analogy to the power known to physics. Bateson’s candidate for “the nearest ‘reality’ to the metaphoric myth of power” is“a large or important part of an ecosystem” (p. 27). This ecosystemic theory of power bears witness to Bateson’s holistic approach, which distinguishes him from most contemporary theorists.

> Bateson often noted the difference between the biological, social,and communicational worlds, which he denominated creatura , and the physical world of forces and impacts, which he denominated pleroma. He would note that, if you kick a stone, the stone will roll using the energy you imparted to it, but if you kick a dog, the dog may turn around and bite you based on its metabolic energy, which it received from its food... perturbations are interactions between the system and its environment, or context,or niche, which trigger changes of state. As Bateson pointed out, this does not involve transfers of energy as in billiard ball physics. Organisms react according to their own organization and history, energized collaterally by their metabolisms.

> Such a relationship can be called an ecological relationship, or a symbiotic relationship (in the widest sense of the word), or in some cases a social relationship (see Maturana and Varela, 1987, p. 180). It can also be called a relationship of mutual adaptation, because both parties are seen to adapt themselves to each other. (Maturana and Varela write, “The adaptation of a unity to an environment, therefore, is a necessary consequence of that unity’s structural coupling with that environment” (1987, p. 102). It is possible in such relationships that an observer will note greater perturbations in one party to the relationship than in another, as the result of their mutual interactions. By greater perturbations I may mean that the observer notes morechanges in A’s structure than in B’s, or that the changes in A’s structure are more fundamental to the preservation of A’s organization as an autopoietic being than the changes in B’s structure are to its self-preservation. I submit, given these premises, that the domain of this inequality between co-interacting, co-structurally-coupled autopoietic systems, is the domain of what we call power, in at least one sense of the term, and also it is the domain of much of what we call dominance in the biological world. And that this is so equally in ecology, animal social organization, and human society.

> The relationship becomes asymmetric in “power” if B , in maintaining B’s autopoiesis, is observed to respond to the presence and activities of A more than A is similarly observed (in maintaining A's own autopoiesis) to respond to the presence and activities of B. The “more” in the last sentence is misleading if it is taken to indicate a simple quantitative relationship like gravity (which is, however, similarly mutual); the “more” may refer to a difference in the profundity of the possible consequences of not responding to the other.

> In Batesonian (second-order cybernetic) terms, relational asymmetry of this type might translate out as follows. Given organisms A and B co-interacting in each others’ environments, certain of the descriptive properties which are true (observed to be enduring) of A, entail or have consequences for B which are more significant to B’s prospects of enduring than the descriptive properties of B are for A.

(As a result, the less powerful organisms must "fit" themselves to the more powerful organisms.)

> Like Foucaultian power, relational asymmetry does not flow from the top down—it can be distinguished by observers as a feature of everyday as well as large-scale social relations, rather than of a distinctive realm of the political that presupposes the actions of governments—and it is, obviously, relational. On the other hand, this view of“power” arising from cybernetics respects, I think, a fundamental and irreducible autonomy of living systems, including human beings, more than some versions of a post-Foucaultian approach seem to do.

# Bachrach & Baratz 1962

> For example, the case—surely not unfamiliar to this audience—of the discontented faculty member in an academic institution headed by a tradition-bound executive. Agrieved about a long-standing policy around which astrong vested interest has developed, the professor resolves in the privacy of his office to launch an attack upon the policy at the next faculty meeting. But, when the moment of truth is at hand, he sits frozen in silence. Why? Among the many possible reasons, one or more of these: could have been of crucial importance: (a) the professor was fearful that his intended action would be interpreted as an expression of his disloyalty to the institution; or (b) he decidcd that, given the beliefs and attitudes of his colleagues on the faculty, he would almost certainly constitute on this issue a minority of one; or c) he concluded that, given the nature of the law-making process in the institution, his proposed remedies would be pigeonholed permanently. But whatever the case, the central point to be made is the same: __to the extent that a person or group-consciously or unconsciously creates or reinforces barriers to the public airing of policy conflicts, that person or group has power__. Or, as Professor Schattschneider has so admirably put it: "All forms of political organization have a bias in favor of the exploitation of some kinds of conflict and the suppression of others because organization is the mobilization of bias. Some issues are organized  into politics while others are organized out."

> As a former vice-president of a large firm says: “What is right in the corporation is not what is right in a man’s home or in his church. What is right in the corporation is what the guy above you wants from you. That’s what morality is in the corporation.” 

> The key interlocking mechanism of this structure is its reporting system. Each manager gathers up the profit targets or other objectives of his or her subordinates and, with these, formulates his commitments to his boss; this boss takes these commitments and those of his other subordinates, and in turn makes a commitment to his boss... It is characteristic of this authority system that details are pushed down and credit is pulled up.

> However, the belief of insiders in abstract goals is not a prerequisite for personal success; belief in and subordination to individuals who articulate organizational goals is. One must, however, to be successful in a bureaucratic work situation, be able to act, at a moment’s notice, as if official reality is the only reality.

> Proper management of one’s external appearances simply signals to one’s peers and to one’s superiors that one is prepared to undertake other kinds of self-adaptation. Managers also stress the need to exercise iron self-control and to have the ability to mask all emotion and intention behind bland, smiling, and agreeable public faces.

> The price of bureaucratic power is a relentlessly methodical subjection of one’s impulses, at least in public.

# Perry (2015): Gardens Need Walls—On Boundaries, Ritual, and Beauty

> In very complex societies, there are some people who are so high in status that it is obligatory to mentally model them, even though they do not reciprocate by mentally modeling their social inferiors. This one-way modeling process usually occurs with the intermediation of media (which is not to say _modern_ media, as this dynamic is thousands of years old).

> When evaluating a patient for dementia, a doctor often asks: who is the President of the United States? If a person does not know the answer to this question, it can usually be inferred that his mind is not functioning normally. This neurological practice is not itself the _reason_ that it is obligatory to know who the President is; rather, because it is _already_ socially obligatory to know who the President is, this question is an effective heuristic to gauge memory function.

quoting Xavier Marquez (2011) "Simple Model of Cults of Personality":

> Here is where cults of personality come in handy. The dictator wants a _credible_ signal of your support; merely staying silent and not saying anything negative won’t cut it. In order to be credible, the signal has to be costly: you have to be willing to say that the dictator is not merely ok, but a superhuman being, and you have to be willing to take some concrete actions showing your undying love for the leader. (You may have had this experience: you are served some food, and you must provide a credible signal that you like it so that the host will not be offended; merely saying that you like it will not cut it. So you will need to go for seconds and layer on the praise). Here the concrete action required of you is typically a willingness to denounce others when they fail to say the same thing, but it may also involve bizarre pilgrimages, ostentatious displays of the dictator’s image, etc.

> When everybody lies about how wonderful the dictator is, there is no common knowledge: you do not know how much of this “support” is genuine and how much is not, which makes it hard to organize against the dictator and exposes one to risks, sometimes enormous risks, if one so much as tries to share one’s true views, since others can signal their commitment to the dictator by denouncing you. This is true of all mechanisms that induce [[preference falsification]], however: they prevent coordination.

On [[_Wild At Heart_]]:
> There are two kinds of power: Cage’s, and Santos. A defensive control, an aggressive control. Just look at Santos in the hotel lobby at 1:07—the old men, walking around on canes, surrounding him, impotent to stop him if they wanted. 
> Both women (both Hellenic blondes) are pulled toward power. Marietta makes a Faustian bargain with the aggressive kind of power, and it predictably eats through her whole world. The voodoo of New Orleans is just one incarnation of what she has summoned. In trying to control the world, she has unraveled it. She has her own kind of power of course, the power which allows her to enlist another sort: she is bewitching, spellbinding (_glamorous_). For her, the rage of Achilles. (For Annie, Agent Cooper.)
