Excellence is excess, is definitionally opposed to balance. Daniel Day-Lewis famously quit his highly intensive method acting after the filming of [[Paul Thomas Anderson|PTA]]'s _Phantom Thread_, because he got the message. 

[[Sam Fussell]] on obsession as life-denying:

> My lifting was life-denying rather than life-affirming. It didn't have to be lifting or muscles, of course. It could have been tax law or eighteenth-century English literature or arbitrage—anything where the obsession precluded all else. I was as twisted, warped and stilted as a bonsai tree. Another of life's miniatures.

On [[Steven Spielberg|Spielberg's]] _Jurassic Park_:

[1:17 PM] suspended reason: but anyway, there are all these scenes where the Men of the movie are so interested in dinos and their work they forget the people around them—Hammond losing site of the safety of his grandkids for the future of his park (his Creation); Alan the paleontologist not noticing when his wife's getting hit on b/c he's so busy looking at dinos
[1:18 PM] suspended reason: In the end, Alan learns and Hammond doesn't: when the helicopter lifts off the island, post-disaster, Hammond is gazing morosely at his little amber'd mosquito in the corner of the 'copter, while Alan and his girlfriend (?) sit happily with Hammond's grandkids appreciating that they're alive
[1:18 PM] suspended reason: Given that Spielberg's a great, prolific director, and great, prolific makers are obsessed & excessive, you have to think the movie is a bit meta- about making movies, and the sacrifices that come with it
[1:20 PM] suspended reason: It's all over the Iliad, it's all over the Bible, it's all over Faust: if you want immortality, you have to give up life itself.
