# Schelling 1960: Strategies of Conflict

[[Thomas Schelling|Schelling]] defines **games of strategy** as any situation in which each player's best choice of action depends on the actions (he expects) the other player will take (and vice-versa, reflexively). This is in contrast to **games of skill** and **games of chance**. "Strategy," then, is the study of conflicting parties' behaviors as they are premised on "the interdependence of the adversaries' decisions and on their expectations about each others' behaviors."

## Bargaining and mixed motives

Of strategy games, there are games of pure cooperation—"**fixed proportion**" of outcomes, i.e. the slice of the pie stays the same even as the pie size itself changes—and pure competition—"**fixed sum**" or zero-sum, where the size of the pie remains constant but the share is variable. Most games are **mixed-motive**, or "bargaining" games—variable sum _and_ variable proportion. What we traditionally call positive or non-zero sum games refer to both mixed and pure coordination games, but [[Thomas Schelling|Schelling]] avoids the zero-/positive-sum frame for its lack of symmetry, preferring pure coordination and pure competition.

Almost all conflict, short of total war of annihilation, is not fixed-sum but variable-sum, or "mixed-motive": while each side has interests that conflict with others' preferences/desires, they also both share common interests, and to some extent can find mutually advantageous outcomes. Conflict is defined as much by common as it is diverging interest.

> To characterize the maneuvers and actions of limited war as a bargaining process is to emphasize that, in addition to the divergence of interest over the variables in dispute, there is a powerful common interest in each.

Bargaining typically occurs on the basis of either mutual improvements over the current state or status quo (as in marketplace haggling for goods) or else by threat of damage—mutual improvement over a hypothetical future state, as is the case in boycotts, strikes, extortion.

**Stalemate**: the situation remains status quo. In a mixed-motive (or "positive-sum") game, stalemate means, "both sides lose."

## Reciprocal modeling of expectations

Thus, strategy is all about informational manipulation of the future opponents' behavior, by strategically self-representing one's own future behavior. In pure coordination games "the player's objective is to make contact with the other player though some imaginative process of introspection," of searching for shared clues, while in pure conflict the "minimax" and randomized minimax strategies are designed specifically "to avoid any meeting of minds" (to be successfully predicted is to more likely be thwarted, is to give the opponent the advantage of optimal response).

> Deterrence is concerned with influencing the choices that another party will make, and doing it by influencing his expectations of how we will behave.

**Credibility** is key to effective (believed) self-representation of future states.

> If a man knocks at a door and says that he will stab himself on the porch unless given $10, he is more likely to get the $10 if his eyes are bloodshot. Similarly, a state that has destroyed cities with nuclear weaponry in the past is more credible in threatening massive retaliation. 

**Tipping points** are the result of recursive expectations, belief that makes real ("self-fulfilling prophecy"): for instance, the expectation among members of a racial community that they will soon be outnumbered in a neighborhood can lead to that community taking flight, moving out in increasing numbers and thus evacuating the neighborhood.

## Tacit bargaining

Tacit bargaining: "adversaries watch and interpret each others' behavior, each aware that his own actions are being interpreted and anticipated, each acting with a view to the expectations that he creates."

### Focal points

In bargaining, each "party's strategy is guided mainly by what he expects the other to accept or insist on: yet each knows that the other is guided by reciprocal thoughts. The final outcome must be a point from which neither expects the other to retreat; yet the main ingredient of this epectation is what one thinks the other expects the first to expect, and so on. Somehow, out of this fluid and indeterminate situation that seemingly provides no logical reason for anybody to expect anything except that he expects to be expected to expect, a decision is reached. These infinitely reflexive expectations must somehow converge on a single point, at which each expects the other not to expect to be expected to retreat."

**Focal points** (or "Schelling points," in common parlance) help facilitate this decision-reaching in both explicit and tacit coordination scenarios. These are default, central, singular, or otherwise conspicuous or conventionally agreed-upon focal points (or "Schelling points," in common parlance). These focal points are enabled by qualities or connotations of the choices (or "labels"), such as round numbers, prime numbers, historical precedents, or other causes of special prominence etc:

> In bargains that involve numerical magnitudes, for example, there seems to be a strong magnetism in mathematical simplicity... [a] tendency for the outcomes to be expressed in 'round numbers]... [or] the frequency with which final agreement is precipitated by an offer to 'split the difference'."

> Precedent seems to exercise an influence that greatly exceeds its logical or legal force.

> There is... a strong attraction to the _status quo ante_ as well as to natural boundaries... Certainly there are reasons of convenience in using rivers as the agreed stopping place for troops or using old boundaries, whatever their current relevance; but often these features of the landscape seem less important for their practical convenience than for their power to crystallize agreement.

These tendencies, of course, once recognized become gameable, and once recognized as gameable are avoided.

### Tacit coordination

**Tacit coordination**: absent the ability to explicitly communicate, we coordinate around focal points, using our "imagination" and "introspective" capacities to search out those points that can magnetically attract both players' expectations, marginalizing the field of possibilities.

Mobs must coordinate action, since legal protection and influence are both born in numbers. Coordination is made easier by the leadership—but leadership, easily identified, is easily picked off. Thus tacit coordination is often necessary, using (inciting) "incidents" to help communicate the "when," and public areas like squares, parks, courthouse steps, etc through precedent, prominence, and logistical advantage (capacity, visibility) allow a tacit "where."

**Bandwagon behavior** is the term Schelling gives for Kuran's "preference cascades": the way that especially vocal or unified pluralities can, through positive feedback loops, reach "tipping" points of dominance.

## Explicit bargaining

Two types of threat: those which explicitly remind or affirm another party of one's already incentivized future actions (e.g., if you have a child with another man, I won't raise it as my own) and those which, "cut off your nose to scorn your face"-style, would _not_ be in the threatening party's incentives _other than as leverage to entice action from the other party_. For instance, it is not typically in the interest of a driver to rear-end a car in front of him if it refuses to move, but the threat may bring about cooperation:

> the threat's efficacy depends on the credulity of the other party, and the threat is ineffectual unless the threatener can rearrange or display his own incentives so as to demonstrate that he would, _ex post_, have an incentive to carry it out.

### Strategic self-binding

If dealing with a rational actor, claimed future actions must be in the actor's self-interest to be believed. Thus, to credibly threaten an action against one's interests, one must either convincingly present oneself as irrational/mad, or else incorrectly informed as to the best way to achieve one's self interest. The alternative is to change one's incentive structure—"self-binding," or committing to a course of action in a binding way.

One approach to defending the second type of threat is to convince the other party that the cost of the ex post action to oneself is small. But is is an unnecessary level of deception: one need only (and would be more efficacious to) persuade the other party that they, the threatening party, was unaware or overly optimistic about the fallout. To feign ignorance or stupidity or madness, a childlike irrationality.

When there is mutual interest, e.g. if a salesman wants to sell a car for at least $12k to turn a profit, but wants to get as much money as possible out of the buyer, the buyer's best move is credibly threatening to walk away past a certain price-point—if he has gone off and signed a contract with a 3rd party to the effect of, "If I pay more than $14k for a car, I owe you $10k," then he has committed to a certain future state: he will not buy a car for more than $14k, and the salesman cannot talk him past that point, can only take it or leave it. In a game of chicken, if one driver throws a steering wheel our the window, he cannot swerve; he is committed. These are all examples of making a self-representation of a future state credible. This "thirdparty commitment" is necessary "when an effective 'second-party commitment' cannot be."

"To be convincing, commitments usually have to be qualitative rather than quantitative, and to rest on some rationale." Theory of mind, in other words, drives bargaining—to understand the other party's interests, to know whether a self-professed future action will, in fact, be pursued.

Genuine weakness—an incapacity to act or choose otherwise—can thus be strength in negotiating. Often, a company or public will use a negotiating agent on their behalf, authorizing him to (e.g.) spend no more than $14k. If he is impotent—lacks the power to spend more on the purchase—then he can credibly claim that $14k is the highest he is able to go, and like the 3rd party contract example, the salesman can then take it or leave it. The executive branch in US government is often "bound" to cap out at certain concessions because they've been decided already by Congress, and getting Congress to change its decree would be a very long, difficult process—thus even if it's in the best interest of the USA to accept a concession, the exec branch cannot negotiate for it, must remain firm—forcing the other party, instead, to concede (to play "chicken").

Self-binding, or "commitment," works by throwing in on the best and worst [[game theory|game-theoretic]] outcomes, eliminating the middle options. One's fate is left in the other party's hands—it is of course in their rational self-interest to choose the option which benefits them, even if it benefits you far more (to a degree that is "unfair")—at least, as compared to stalemating or entering a more serious conflict. But sometimes the other party, either from irrationality, spite, or a desire to set future precedent ("we don't negotiate with terrorists") will "cut off their nose to spite [your] face."

#### Precedent and self-binding

Another form of binding: "If I did it for you, I'd have to do it for everyone else." In ongoing (iterated) negotiations, establishing a baseline and not deviating even when it is beneficial short-term for you to do so is key to, in the future, being able to hold strong and force the other party to conceed.

"Both the kidnapper who would like to release his prisoner, and the prisoner, may search desperately for a way to commit the latter against informing on his captor"—for instance, the prisoner might commit some unspeakable crime, or confess to a past one, or be in some way complicit with the kidnapping, such that the kidnapper "holds one over" on him.

### Establishing trust

Ongoing cooperation is a subset of [[reputation]].

> What makes many agreements enforceable is only the recognition of future opportunities for agreement that will be eliminated if mutual trust is not created and maintained and whose value outweighs the momentary gain from cheating.

To create ("a tradition of") trust, parties must "be willing to risk a small investment or two, whose precedent establishes reliability and mutual longterm interest."

(See also _intimacy_: the languages of approached intimacy are the same as corporatespeak: feeling vulnerable, exposed, belly up—the soft underside.)

## Private information and unobservable outcomes

> The mandatory secret ballot is a nuisance to the voter who would like to sell his vote, but protection to the one who would fear coercion.

> Fulfillment is not always observable. If one sells his vote in a secret election, or a government agrees to recommend an act to its parliament, or an employee agrees not to steal from inventory, or a teacher agrees to keep his political opinions out of class, or a country agrees to stimulate exports 'as much as possible,' there is no reliable way to observe or measure compliance. The observable outcome is subject to a number of influences, only one of which is covered by the agreement. The bargain may therefore have to be expressed in terms of something observable, even though what is observable is not the intended object of the bargain. One may have to pay the bribed voter if the election is won, not on how he voted; to pay the salesman a commission on sales, rather than on skill and effort; to reward policemen according to statistics on crime rather than on attention to duty; or to punish all employees for the transgressions of one. And, where performance is a matter of degree, the bargain may have to define arbitrary limits distinguishing performance from nonperformance; a specified loss of inventory treated as evidence of theft; a specified increase in exports considered an 'adequate' effort; specified samples of performance taken as representative of total performance.

## Tradition and norms in interdependent decisions

(See also Friston's work on shared [[scripts]], e.g. "A Duet For One.")

Players in mixed-motive bargaining games are on a "search for stable, mutually nondestructive, recognizable patterns of movement"—they are "participating in the creation of traditions." This [[legibility|legible]] allows efficient, cooperative [[intelligence as futures optimization|mutual modeling of futures]].

In making oneself [[legibility||legible]] this way, one may pull on "Historical and literary precedent, legal and moral casuistry, mathematics and [[aesthetics]], as well as familiar analogues from other walks of life"—since these too are the interpretive frames one's opponents will employ to process, [[metonyms|metonymically]] one's moves.

# Reason 2020: Reflections on Schelling's bargaining

Everyday bargaining examples: childrearing, threat of leaving/terminating an interaction or relationship, trying to "keep the peace" or appease, instances of "sweetening the deal," e.g. by doing the "heavylifting."

Family dynamics are strained, in part, because their love is UNCONDITIONAL: all other relationships _are_ conditional, and because they were entered for ostensibly postivie-sum reasons (it was better for both parties to be in the relationship than out of it—be it a platonic, sexual, romantic, or business relationship) there is a mutual interest that can be disrupted. Partners keep "scoresheets" or tallies, they "feel" they are pulling all the weight, or their partner is slacking off and not pulling his. 

Ben Lerner tells a story about raising his children. He'll try to get them out of bed in the morning and dressed for school by threatening their dessert that evening. And they'll say, "I don't want dessert tonight." And he'll go, "Well, you won't get dessert ever again." And they'll say, "I hate dessert, I was just pretending to like it to be polite, I'll go my whole life without dessert just to show you." One way to see this is as pure irrationality—but the other is that they are calling his bluff. They understand—or hypothesize, perhaps more accurately—that it is a bluff, and they are testing to see whether he will actually go through with the punishment. In other words: is his word binding? Is his self-representation true?

"Morality" as an institution disincentives cruelty in two ways: first, by instill an actor with a sense of conscience, in which cruelty is psychically harmful to the actor inflicting it. Second, by premising group [[reputation]] on cruelty, such that cruel individuals are avoided or ostracized. In situations where an individual _must_, in a sense, be cruel—for instance, situations in which "tough love" of the parenting or teaching variety brings out the best in the punished agent—"serialized" or "incremental" punishments help offload some of the punishing agent's sense of responsibility. By repeatedly engaging in a behavior which he knows to lead to punishment, the offending agent is "choosing ruin" as if voluntarily. A teacher, for instance, likely prefers many small tests over a semester to the moral agony of deciding whether to flunk a student for a single bad performance (in a sense, "without warning"). Similarly, in siege situations, where citizens slowly starve as their food supplies are cut off, there are many opportunities to concede—it is their "stubbornness" or "spite" which "volunteers" them for their fate. By committing, the besieging party has put the decision of the other party's survival in that party's hand—self-determination.

Most social interactions are both cooperative and adversarial, defined both by common and diverging interests.

# Robert Abdieh 1994: Strategy of Boilerplate

> the essential dynamic in bargaining is one of coordination. Contrary to the rhetoric sometimes used to describe bargaining, the ultimate goal is not to win but to agree. Agree on one's preferred terms, no doubt, but agree nonetheless.

# Harsanyi 1962: Bargaining in ignorance of the opponent’s utility function

The traditional "Zeuthen-Nash theory of two-person bargaining games... is based on the assumption that the two parties know each other's utility functions... each other's preferences as well as each other's attitudes toward risk." This situation is not realistic in everyday life. He suggests a "[[typification|stereotype]] utility function," a situation of shared knowledge in both the stereotyped and stereotyping individual typically are aware of the approximate utility function associated with their stereotype.

Vollmer 2013 writes:

> The prominence that the differentiation of players and their utility functions into types assumes in Harsanyi's discussion resonates with the attributional type of verbal signalling and sanctioning evidence in the course of Garfinkel's breaching experiments [that is, many expectations were set by roles, and involved identity-based speculation of [[intent]]] and also with the potential evolutionary benefits of segregation [insofar as homogenous communities can better anticipate and model one another's utility functions].
