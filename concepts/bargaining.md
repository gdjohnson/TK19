# Reason 2020: Reflections on Schelling's bargaining

Everyday bargaining examples: childrearing, threat of leaving/terminating an interaction or relationship, trying to "keep the peace" or appease, instances of "sweetening the deal," e.g. by doing the "heavylifting."

Family dynamics are strained, in part, because their love is UNCONDITIONAL: all other relationships _are_ conditional, and because they were entered for ostensibly postivie-sum reasons (it was better for both parties to be in the relationship than out of it—be it a platonic, sexual, romantic, or business relationship) there is a mutual interest that can be disrupted. Partners keep "scoresheets" or tallies, they "feel" they are pulling all the weight, or their partner is slacking off and not pulling his. 

Ben Lerner tells a story about raising his children. He'll try to get them out of bed in the morning and dressed for school by threatening their dessert that evening. And they'll say, "I don't want dessert tonight." And he'll go, "Well, you won't get dessert ever again." And they'll say, "I hate dessert, I was just pretending to like it to be polite, I'll go my whole life without dessert just to show you." One way to see this is as pure irrationality—but the other is that they are calling his bluff. They understand—or hypothesize, perhaps more accurately—that it is a bluff, and they are testing to see whether he will actually go through with the punishment. In other words: is his word binding? Is his self-representation true?

"Morality" as an institution disincentives cruelty in two ways: first, by instill an actor with a sense of conscience, in which cruelty is psychically harmful to the actor inflicting it. Second, by premising group [[reputation]] on cruelty, such that cruel individuals are avoided or ostracized. In situations where an individual _must_, in a sense, be cruel—for instance, situations in which "tough love" of the parenting or teaching variety brings out the best in the punished agent—"serialized" or "incremental" punishments help offload some of the punishing agent's sense of responsibility. By repeatedly engaging in a behavior which he knows to lead to punishment, the offending agent is "choosing ruin" as if voluntarily. A teacher, for instance, likely prefers many small tests over a semester to the moral agony of deciding whether to flunk a student for a single bad performance (in a sense, "without warning"). Similarly, in siege situations, where citizens slowly starve as their food supplies are cut off, there are many opportunities to concede—it is their "stubbornness" or "spite" which "volunteers" them for their fate. By committing, the besieging party has put the decision of the other party's survival in that party's hand—self-determination.

All interactions are both cooperative and adversarial, defined both by common and diverging interests.

> the essential dynamic in bargaining is one of coordination. Contrary to the rhetoric sometimes used to describe bargaining, the ultimate goal is not to win but to agree. Agree on one's preferred terms, no doubt, but agree nonetheless.

# Harsanyi 1962: Bargaining in ignorance of the opponent’s utility function

The traditional "Zeuthen-Nash theory of two-person bargaining games... is based on the assumption that the two parties know each other's utility functions... each other's preferences as well as each other's attitudes toward risk." This situation is not realistic in everyday life. He suggests a "[[typification|stereotype]] utility function," a situation of shared knowledge in both the stereotyped and stereotyping individual typically are aware of the approximate utility function associated with their stereotype.

Vollmer 2013 writes:

> The prominence that the differentiation of players and their utility functions into types assumes in Harsanyi's discussion resonates with the attributional type of verbal signalling and sanctioning evidence in the course of Garfinkel's breaching experiments [that is, many expectations were set by roles, and involved identity-based speculation of [[intent]]] and also with the potential evolutionary benefits of segregation [insofar as homogenous communities can better anticipate and model one another's utility functions].
