All communication is manipulation. Some manipulation is mutually advantageous.

> Broadly speaking, Alice ideally must first be sphinxlike in character to pull any of this off. She must foster [[ambiguity]] about what her ultimate goals are in order to have an advantage over those around her. This style of behavior is called “robust action” in sociology. For Alice to be an ideal manipulator, her actions must be interpretable from multiple perspectives at once, potentially function as moves in multiple [[concepts/games]] at once, and conceal her public and private motivations. This maintains her flexibility and discretion and thwarts attempts by rivals to narrow her space of choices. Forced clarification of her [[commitment|commitments]] and lock-in to hard goals only gives Bob an ability to constrain her.

(See also _interpersonal legibility_, not to be confused with legibility in the systems sense.)

All language is strategic representation in the interest of creating effects via the alteration of individuals' mental models. _Speech acts_ are instances of language operating within purely symbolic domains (i.e. without corresponding territory).

Karen Pryor, _Don't Shoot the Dog_:
> To people schooled in the humanistic tradition, the manipulation of human behavior by some sort of conscious technique seems incorrigibly wicked, in spite of the obvious fact that we all go around trying to manipulate one another’s behavior all the time, by whatever means come to hand.

[[Adam Smith]], _The Theory of Moral Sentiments_:
> The offering of a shilling, which to us appears to have so plain and simple a meaning, is in reality offering an argument to persuade someone to do so and so as it is for his interest. And in this manner every one is practicing oratory on others through the whole of his life.
