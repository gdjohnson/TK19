All communication is manipulation. Some manipulation is mutually advantageous.

I do not mean, as the term is sometimes taken as, cases of communication where "the listener cannot see the speaker's covered intentions behind what is actually being said" (Asya 2013, "Linguistic Manipulation: Definition and Types," _IJCRSEE_).

Conversations are sigmergic co-constructions of nudges which advance interests by variably representing and obscuring interests; these interests are navigated on the basis of the balance of interpersonal power. Those with more power are typically given more license and decision-making influence.

Karen Pryor, _Don't Shoot the Dog_:
> To people schooled in the humanistic tradition, the manipulation of human behavior by some sort of conscious technique seems incorrigibly wicked, in spite of the obvious fact that we all go around trying to manipulate one anotherâ€™s behavior all the time, by whatever means come to hand.

[[Adam Smith]], _The Theory of Moral Sentiments_:
> The offering of a shilling, which to us appears to have so plain and simple a meaning, is in reality offering an argument to persuade someone to do so and so as it is for his interest. And in this manner every one is practicing oratory on others through the whole of his life.

This view of communication is founded on observations from animal signaling (e.g. [["Animal Signals - Mind-Reading and Manipulation"]]) and the framing in [[ethnomethodology]] which understands the interpretation of a receiver (and thus the meaning of the message) in how said receiver responds.
