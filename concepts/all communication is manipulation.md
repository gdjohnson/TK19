All communication is manipulation. Some manipulation is mutually advantageous.

Alternatively phrased, the purpose of speech, broadly, is the alteration of others' actions. Or, _Communication is defined by its interest in altering the receiver's actions_. It is clear how this is true of imperative statements: we give orders so that they will be followed; we make requests so they will be fulfilled. But it is equally true of indicative, that is, representational statements. We achieve transformative alterations of others' behavior through our strategic representation of reality, including (but far from limited to) our own internal state; our representation work carries this transformational power precisely because it is on a crowd-sourced model or perception of reality, on which we all base our actions. 

(This crowd-sourcing, whereby we allow others to tell us about themselves—as the predator "listens to" the red stripes on a dart frog—gives us access to mission-relevant information far beyond our own immediate ability to know; in cooperative arrangements, agents can multiply one another's experiential base many times over, a process culminating in written texts and cultural transmission. But this crowd-sourcing also opens us up sabotage.)

I am,  in fact, of the opinion that imperative statements can be functionally described as indicative statements that represent the desires of a requesting individual, to an individual who has an interest in fulfilling these desires. (E.g. because of a formal system of punishment that can be found in the military, or because one wishes to ingratiate themselves with the other, or because they are engaged in a relationship of reciprocity, etc.)

All language is strategic representation in the interest of creating effects via the alteration of individuals' mental models. _Speech acts_ are instances of language operating within purely symbolic domains (i.e. without corresponding territory).

Conversations are sigmergic co-constructions of nudges which advance interests by variably representing and obscuring interests; these interests are navigated on the basis of the balance of interpersonal power. Those with more power are typically given more license and decision-making influence.

Karen Pryor, _Don't Shoot the Dog_:
> To people schooled in the humanistic tradition, the manipulation of human behavior by some sort of conscious technique seems incorrigibly wicked, in spite of the obvious fact that we all go around trying to manipulate one another’s behavior all the time, by whatever means come to hand.

[[Adam Smith]], _The Theory of Moral Sentiments_:
> The offering of a shilling, which to us appears to have so plain and simple a meaning, is in reality offering an argument to persuade someone to do so and so as it is for his interest. And in this manner every one is practicing oratory on others through the whole of his life.

This view of communication is founded on observations from animal signaling (e.g. [["Animal Signals - Mind-Reading and Manipulation"]]) and the framing in [[ethnomethodology]] which understands the interpretation of a receiver (and thus the meaning of the message) in how said receiver responds.

# Rorty, "Freud and Moral Reflection"

> I think that we can live with the Freudian thought that everything everybody does to everyone else (even those they love blindly and helplessly) can be described, for therapeutic or other purposes, as manipulation.

> the more concrete criticisms of modern ways of thinking offered by [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] in [[_After Virtue_]] are more immediately relevant to the topics I have been discussing. MacIntyre would agree, more or less, with my description of the connections between Baconian ways of thought and Nietzschean values. But he takes the fact that the paradigmatic character-types of modernity are "the Rich Aesthete, the Manager, and the Therapist" (p. 29) to show that these ways of thought, and these values, are undesirable. In Maclntyre's view, the abandonment of an Aristotelian "functional concept of man" leads to "emotivism" — the obliteration of any genuine distinction between manipulative and non-manipulative social relations"

# Reason

## Manipulation is always value-neutral on certain axes

Sometimes people get upset when I say "All communication is manipulation." They say, Spendo, sometimes I just share accurate information to the recipient. I'm not trying to manipulate them to follow a specific course of action, I'm just trying to inform them of relevant details!

And that's right. A manipulation is always value neutral on _some_ axes—e.g. regarding the manner in which a task is executed, or the kind of task selected for execution.

Indeed, the party passing along information, in a given interaction, may have no agenda in terms of what the individual does with the information.

But it's still manipulative in the strict sense of attempting bring about better outcomes for the speaker. And the best way to illustrate this is through counterfactual, to say, "What are the things that would or would not occur if the speaker did not speak now, as they have?" That is, what would the differences in the world be, as relevant to the speaker's goals, if they did not speak, and did not speak as they have?

And all these difference, you will find, are mediated by eventual actions, however delayed, on the part of the recipient. For this is the only way that speech can be "a difference that makes a difference"—through a mediating receiver who acts differently as a consequence of receiving the speech.

So, perhaps, if I am asked by a colleague to provide information on a topic, and do not answer, there may be consequences I do not desire. And if I provide inaccurate information, there may be consequences I do not desire. This can be more adversarial, selfish, and cloistered: I may speak only to avoid reprimand from my project manager. Or they may be more expansive, cooperative: I may want to provide accurate information because that will lead to the best results for the organization, in which I hold equity. They may be highly pro-social: I may not want to strain the relationship between myself and the querying colleague.

When we think of "manipulation" we can err by seeing it as a narrow attempt to determine _the specific procedure of action_ the manipulated party follows. But we may merely provide the information so that _any_ procedure of action is followed, and this too is an alteration of the receiver's actions through the provision of speech.

## In defense of ACiM

Once again, I write in order to address a round of objections to my contention that “All communication is manipulation; some manipulation is mutually advantageous”

First, to clarify the contested meaning of “manipulation”: I intend it here in the neutral, manual sense in which one manipulates an object. It is any alteration of the receiver’s informational state (any any such “meaningful” alteration must eventually result in some alteration of their actions in order to “cash out” in an altered reality). Because ultimately, the reason for the manipulation, in the first place, is that we are “ecologically huddled,” as organisms—my actions affect yours, and vice-versa, so that our futures and outcomes are interdependent. And so I may manipulate in order to prevent an action on your part which would impact me negatively, or to bring about an action on your part that might impact me positively. I may do this very simply, by saying “Stop that” or “Do this,” or I may do it subtly, perhaps by representing reality in such a way that the action appears contra your own interests. If we are in a cooperative agreement, it may be enough to point out that the action goes against my interests, and is therefore contra yours in turn. I may perform the manipulation honestly, by giving my best assessment of the actual effects of the action, or I may do it dishonestly, by giving a false impression of the world and the action’s effects on it. 

Often, in social life, we reserve the word “manipulation” for this last kind of behavior, and view manipulation, as a class, pejoratively. But manipulation, both of the hidden and overt kind, manipulation where the manipulated party is aware that the manipulator is attempting to have effects on them, happens constantly. It is the building block of interpersonal behavior. Not just when I say, “The milk will spoil if you leave it out,” or say “Thank you for putting the milk away” to encourage future milk-putting-away—but when I shout your name across a field and you turn. When I tell you I’m running out to the grocery, so you do not wonder where I’ve gone, so that you’ll tell me any items you’d like me to purchase. These "so that"'s—in another word, the _reason_ (or purpose, or function) of the speech, just is, and can never not be, the alteration of a person's behavior. Since, to have a reason or purpose means to alter the world, to bring about a delta. (Acts which do not alter the world, or do not alter them in a way significant to the actor's goals, are called "pointless.") And communication can only affect the world through human beings, who acts as its mediator, who actualize the potential of the Word through physical act (or further chains of words). Information is not a force like energy, heat, inertia; it requires intelligent receivers to have effects, which is to say, to function.

Casual conversation, from this vantage point, is a stigmergic co-creation, a series of nudges and prompts, much like partners dance a waltz. I prompt you with a question, in order that you provide a response which might inform me, or abet my curiosity, or merely to further the conversation and its spirit of good feeling or solidarity which it creates. 

A common objection, here, is two-fold. One, that the speaker does not feel like he is looking for a particular ends to result from his speech—he doesn’t want to “railroad” his interlocutor into a certain response or action; he is keeping things “open” so that his interlocutor can choose how to respond on his own accord. That the interaction is consensual and co-created. We wish very strongly to preserve this appearance of neutrality! 

The second objection is that, more broadly, the speaker does not _feel_ like he has any agenda at all. His interactions do not feel like manipulation, like he is attempting to get others to change their behaviors, change their moods, manipulate their brain states, alter their sense of reality. And it is worth noting here that such goals are highly stigmatized. The idea of “messing with someone’s mental model,” of giving them preconceptions, of altering their perception of reality, of puppeteering them into action, is horrifying to a polite, civilized individual who considers himself pro-social, believes his interactions are always free and consensual, that he does not engage in deceptive or manipulative practices. 

When we begin thinking this way, that the explanation for our behavior can't “fit” because it doesn't seem aligned with our felt experience, then I think we need to pull out, and look at the problem differently. On an autobiographical note, I came to this theory of speech—to the phrase that “All communication is manipulation; some manipulation is advantageous”—not through introspection, but from learning about signaling in non-human organisms. In all known, non-human superorganisms—in body cells, bacteria, body cells, animals, and even institutions and organizations—the function of communicating, to other superorganisms outside oneself, is always the manipulation of those superorganisms’ behavior. The company produces public relations material and advertising. The bird puffs out its plumage or sings its song to attract mates and intimidate rivals. The symbiotic bacteria fire off signals to one another, “so that” they may synchronize their behavior—but we err in our teleological language here; there is no "intent," in the way we usually think of intent, in these cells, rather, there is a fact that if cell A fires signal X, cell B will perform action Y, and that this relationship of informing or manipulating is evolutionarily advantageous and stable. Communicative actions, or signals, which did not improve the (reproductive) prospects of the communicator, simply disappeared through natural selection. (Dominance, survival, strong alliances, securing food or other resources, are all means or surrogates to this end, and thus speech which secures them is preserved.) And the only way that a signal can improve the situation, for the signaler, is by altering the behavior of those who receive the signal. 

And so, when we turn to human affairs, we ought, as our default hypothesis, assume that communication among us serves the same function, works the same way. It is true that phenomenologically, it does not _feel_ often as if we are attempting to manipulate others, and from a social perspective, it would be dangerous to fess up to such a motivation, hidden or conscious. And yet, when we study bees, and watch them dance, and after their dance, the other bees fly to a location scouted by the dancer, we say “the purpose of the dance is to communicate a location for a new hive.” The phenomenology of the bee is more or less irrelevant; it may well dance, and dance the way it does, _for the pleasure of it_. 

What we are left with, here, I think, is that there are two very different perspectives on a system. One is functionalist, the other psychological. One looks only at the patterns of behavior, and the patterns of effects which stem from this behavior, and defines the behavior in terms of its effects. The other is interested in the goal which the individual actor seeks out, his own self-ascription of motivation as it feels from the inside. 

Now, what is crucial is that these two motivations are more or less synchronized. The actor may act on the basis of a feeling, or a desire for pleasure, when he initiates sex with a person of the opposite sex. He may say it was “for” pleasure, and in a sense it is. And in another sense, it is clear that this behavior is about and for reproduction.

I think the best way to square this is with the concept of mesa- and base-optimizers. A base-optimizer is a selection algorithm which selects which individuals survive. The individuals it selects are called mesa-optimizers; they have their own priorities, but their priorities have been selected and trained against the logic of their base-optimizer, such that the two are in alignment. Natural selection is one such base-optimizer: organisms who feel pleasure upon sexual intercourse end up reproducing—are selected by the base—even if the thing they are optimizing for, in their place as mesa-, is pleasure. And we can note that there will be divergences here, especially when the environment changes the careful, contextual coupling between mesa- and base-optimizer goals: birth control is one such major uncoupling, such that pleasure and reproduction no longer go hand-in-hand like they once did.

Similarly, within a company structure, a manager who hires, promotes, demotes, and fires employees is acting as base optimizer for the mesa-optimizers that are his employees. Let us say, to simplify, that his selections are based on how the employees advance the company interest. Employees who show up for work early in the morning, bleary-eyed, or who turn in their inventory reports on time, do not typically do it “for” the benefit of the company. They do it so that they are not reprimanded or eventually fired; they do it to stay within good standing in the training system or selection algorithm of the base optimizer. And yet they clearly also do it “for” the company! The objective outcome their behavioral patterns is advancing company interests. Even as the “internal” logic is one of personal incentive and reward, the “external” logic is company interest.

And so, in conversation, when we speak and optimize and act “so that” others have a good impression of us, this good impression may feel like all we care about as individuals, but it is also clear that a good impression (and good impression in specific, goal-relevant ways) will improve our situation, lead to better outcomes in most cases than a bad impression. Or, when we speak “in order that” we get rid of some nagging feeling which is eating at us, what is this feeling, if not a surrogate, a proxy, which has evolved to yield outcomes which broadly advance our interests. Evolved not just biologically, over generations, but culturally, through the training system that is society. We make millions if not billions of utterances and communicative moves in our lifetimes, from the clothes we choose, to our facial expressions, to the way we talk and write. And though causality is complex, in a welter of many simultaneous, bundled communication moves or “tactics,” we do note, and feel strongly, the effects of a strategic mis-step: when we turn someone against us without desiring to; when we upset someone we wished not to upset; when an interaction goes south and does not end how we hoped it might.

I realize I have not yet addressed the first objection, that speakers do not have specific, narrow agendas for the behavior they want to evoke from receivers. They may just want to “have an honest conversation,” to get their interlocutors to “speak their mind” or enjoy themselves or say whatever feels appropriate. This is certainly true—there are always certain axes on which our desire, for an outcome, is underspecified or left vague. We may hope for a certain tone, while caring nothing of the content, or vice-versa. In a police interrogation, the speaker tone, during a confession, may not matter to the interrogator’s goals. Whether he goes on a vile, profanity-laden tirade in the midst of his confession may be of little concern to the officer, so long as the confession follows. Rather than seek incredibly specific outcomes, we recognize that there are entire classes of outcomes which are approximately commensurate in terms of advancing our immediate and long-term interests, and we are more or less agnostic to which entry from that class ends is selected by the interlocutor. What matters is the general class. Thus we can note that, if we were trying to have an “open-ended” conversation about psychology at a party, and one interlocutor kept answering our comments or inquiries with criticisms of the event catering, we would perhaps get frustrated and walk away from the conversation. So much for “agenda-less” interaction. Clearly we wanted something, wanted our interlocutor to behave, to act in a specific way, and weren’t getting it. We learn from negativa—learn our expectations and hopes through their upset and disappointment, through our reactions when they fail to materialize.

So, to summarize, there are several arguments here:

* One: that we ought not give much credence to our phenomenology or introspection in determining what motivates us _from the perspective which _the phrase “All communication is manipulation” takes. Rather, we should look at objective patterns of behaviors and effects, since these effects are the thing on which we are culturally and biologically trained—the reinforcement loops which select for and select out.
* Two: that it ought be our null hypothesis that human communication serves the purpose of altering receiver actions, since that is true of all non-human communication, and we are nothing if not bound up in the same environmental context, and the same family history, with non-human organisms. 
* Three: that there are different “levels” of rationale behind our behavior, and that many of the things we desire, we desire instrumentally insofar as their attainment tends to correlate with other valuable outcomes, for instance, we may eat “for” flavor but our taste buds have evolved for nutrition, thus we eat “for” nutrition.

To expand on the first point, there is a large body of literature, from psychoanalysis to evolutionary psychology, that distrusts self-reflection, in terms of feelings and phenomenology, as a source of behavioral insight. These theories broadly hold that we self-deceive in significant ways, and especially that we self-deceive about our motivations. That we do this either to prevent the psychic pain (or dissonance) of acknowledging some fact about our motivations, or in order to be more strategically competitive in the social arena, since by lying to ourselves we are better able to lie to others. Which is to say, it is no coincidence that manipulation is both the air we breathe, socially, and that it is deeply stigmatized, socially. We are wary and terrified of being manipulated even as we are nothing _but_ manipulated; every interaction we have manipulates us. As soon as we learn that someone has an agenda or is motivated, to speak in the way they do, to represent reality the way they do, we distrust them. And yet all our representations are motivated, why would we speak for no purpose, why would we act when it changes nothing? And yet as a result of this stigma our agendas must go underground, even as we have become deeply confused about the behavior which we fear. It is not manipulation in the neutral sense, but a dishonest manipulation in which we are led, under false guises, to act in ways which hurt our own best interests. And yet most representation is in some way dishonest, in some way elides true facts which are unbecoming to the speaker. As Goffman notes, members of the clergy, asked why they entered the profession, never mention that it helps advance their social standing—although this is almost certainly a strong motivation. (How does Goffman guess they are hiding this motivation? Because it is a clear, objective, externally visible benefit of the clergy, and Goffman assumes that clear benefits of some action become attractors _for_ that action, even if it does not “feel” like a or the reason for the actor.) And when we argue for something, we rarely acknowledge to a full extent the merit of the other side; even when we try to, it is likely our brains do not put quite as much effort into investigating the merit of the other side—is this not manipulation, then, to argue? Is this not dishonest representation? The line between what we find repellant, in terms of manipulation, and what we expect or find banal, is as of yet unclear to me. Certainly, honesty and outcome matter, but they are nothing near sufficient and necessary criteria. Likely, as with most of our language, the actual way we use “manipulation” in the social, pejorative sense does not have some clear conceptual logic, but rather is dictated by a _pragmatic_ logic: we call things manipulative in a tool, a gambit, to either change the behavior of the individual we find manipulative, or to change other’s impressions and beliefs about the manipulative individual, to lessen the base of his support, and perhaps extract revenge or punish him. The very blurriness and ubiquity of manipulation serves to make the term a weapon without check—almost any speech or behavior can be cast, accurately, as manipulative, since it _is_ manipulative in the strict sense we’ve used throughout. And yet this sense of manipulative, of attempting to alter an individual’s behavior, is not, cannot be, the criteria by which we judge actions to be moral trespasses. Thus, I believe there is an ameliorative effect of defining all communication as manipulation, insofar as it forces us to identify the actual behavior or communicative qualities we find reprehensible, which are not and cannot be “the alteration of the receiver’s actions through strategic representation.”

To expand on the second point—that human communication as manipulation ought be our null hypothesis, given it is true of all non-human signaling—it is also worth nothing that, as communication is a class of action, and we broadly expect for our actions to “have a purpose” or reason—that is, to alter the world in a way which brings it more in line with our ideal, an ideal which can be selfish or selfless—then we should expect communication to behave the same way. That it is motivated, that it desires to have effects, and—since the only way information can have effects is as interpreted by another agent, thus altering that agent’s representation of the world, and thereby as a final step, altering his actions—that it desires to have these effects by altering the actions of its receiver.

Finally, to expand on the third point, it is worth talking about the nested structure of surrogates we navigate. A surrogate, briefly, is something that “stands for” something else, the way that a credential may stand for professional competence. Crucially, surrogates have a strong tendency to be “reified”: although they were instituted as a proxy standing for some more important quality, or in their service as a means to an end, they have a tendency to become fetishized as ends in their own right. Phenomenologically, we can feel as if what we care about, and are seeking out, is the surrogate, even as the purpose of that surrogate is what it stands for (and thus, the purpose of our seeking out, syllogistically, is “ultimately” to locate what the surrogate stands for, not the surrogate). Thus, we might phrase a sentence one way because it “feels right” or “seems appropriate,” but this sense of appropriateness is no doubt formed by acculturation, and likely feels “right” insofar as it incorporates the speaker’s goals, and so how else can we view this, other than as a dispatch from the unconscious, a selection based in factors we are only darkly aware of? 

All this points to how thorny the question of motivation, purpose, and “for”-ness is. When we are sitting, pained, in a mathematics course as classmates present dreadful, wrong answers, and are overwhelmed by the desire to correct the record and present our own (we believe correct) solution, and when we raise our hand to do so—and when our presentation of a correct solution leads us to be seen, by our peers and professor, as presenting the correct answer; when it distinguishes us in some way, and perhaps changes the estimation others hold of us; and when this change in estimation alters their actions—say, the professor is more likely to write us a letter of recommendation—then what can we say the reason for our blurting was? To satisfy a feeling? To alter impressions? Or to secure a letter of recommendation? I think the answer is “all of the above.” Furthermore, what is “social standing” or “access to resources” except a surrogate to reproductive mate quality, in some ultimate evolutionary sense? And I think this complexity of motivation, reason, and “for”-ness is part of why the idea “All communication is manipulation” is so thorny, and requires anchoring to a specific perspective, the perspective of agents who behave in a way that is biologically and culturally programmed, for ultimate reasons that are only partially or “surrogatedly” salient to them.

# What does cooperative manipulation look like?

Often, of course, it will be more pragmatically useful a carving to speak of an individual influencing a belief, or of an individual manipulating a "situation"—for instance, the salient thing which I may feel I am intervening on, and optimizing, may be the mood of a social event, or an emergent social dynamic; I may try to "break the ice," or "lighten the mood." I do not think that framing interaction as manipulation of others' actions is always the optimal framing for understanding human encounters, as there are meaningful, emergent macro properties (such as mood or vibe or dynamic) which serve the purpose better. But the purpose of lightening the mood or breaking the ice must be seen and acknowledged, ultimately, as ploys to bring out or suppress certain actions in others—to discourage, or introduce a social penalty, to those who speak in negative, abusive tones; or to encourage, and hopefully bring out, self-disclosure and expression on the part of shy strangers, for the purpose of their bonding, becoming intimate, becoming acquainted, etc.

In many but not all cases, the manipulation will be transparent, at least at one level of aim. Following the pattern of Gricean linguistics, an expression will be conveyed in the form of "I intend you to form a belief based on my speech act, but I also intend you to recognize that I have that intention." (Which, actions and beliefs are roughly symmetrical; altering beliefs matters because people's beliefs cash out to actions.) This transparency is of course limited in scope: When I share a story that conveys a given moral, you may recognize that I wish to convey said moral, without realizing that the story is false. That is, we often understand exactly what people are up to even as we are being deceived: we understand that their speech has been designed to accomplish the effect it accomplishes even as we do not know whether the representation accomplishing said effect corresponds to reality (or to the speaker's picture of reality).

This Gricean's formulation highlights how manipulation can be perfectly cooperative, transparent, and non-adversarial, insofar as the manipulation is often very legible. When we are asked a question, we understand the speaker wants an answer. When our name is shouted, we understand the speaker wants our attention. "Oh, he wants me to compliment him on the dish he prepared" is a subtle thing where we recognize people "go fishing" ie are looking for sets of effects and don't even mind giving them (though some personalities grate against this & refuse to give people what they're after if they stoop to being transparent about it).

Sometimes, we are transparent about both our desire to be manipulated, and our manipulation of others. These cases include requests in the business world to "pitch me" or "persuade me," or dating dynamics in which (archetypally, a woman) desires to be talked into a relationship, or into sexual engagement. When we feel torn or ambivalent, we may call upon others to resolve our ambivalence through a strong rhetorical showing, and will feel swayed to one position or another even as we acknowledge that the account we have received is highly partial and highly interested (in the sense of motivated or biased).

Always, our manipulations of others are norm-governed. The simplest norm, itself a form of manipulation, is that individuals typically (except in cases like those mentioned above) hide that they are manipulating, that they may have ulterior motives, that their representation is biased by personal projects. We act as if we are representing reality neutrally, and other individuals tend to treat us as if we are representing reality neutrally—we are, broadly, taken at our face—unless the situation is especially high-stakes, or the individual in question has discredited himself previously through discovered deception. This works because we are interested not in the full reality behind the representation, and the full correspondence between reality and representation, but in the relevance of the information supplied to our own missions, our own projects, desires, goals, etc. We will happily concede that an account given to us may elide details which would embarrass the speaker, and that the speaker is typically not disinterested in the account given, but what really concerns us is whether the general portrait provided is adequate and useful to advancing our projects. And we trust that this is generally so, that our agendas are not regularly being sabotaged, at least by allies in whom we have built long-term relationships, because if we receive an impression of reality from such an ally, and act on it, and this impression and our action backfire on us, we will blame the impression and the individual who fostered it. 

This norm of suppressing the manipulative quality of communication extends even to protecting those who manipulate us (and not merely in cloaking our own strategic representations). An individual who advances a highly biased interpretation of a situation will have their account taken "with a grain of salt," but the receiving party is more likely to call the matter "subjective" than he is to accuse the account-giver of manipulation. An individual who advances objectively disprovable claims will often be considered merely mistaken. It is only when it is abundantly clear that the individual (1) advances demonstrably false claims, (2) knew very well these claims were false at the time of advancement, that we accuse him of attempting to manipulate us by presenting an inaccurate portrait of the situation. 

# Objections that this is a non-standard use of "manipulation"

[[John Nerst]] 2017, "A Lament on [[Kevin Simler|Simler]] Et Al":

> Alright, what’s bothering me [about Simler's "Leaning Tower of Morality"]? The conflation of “self-interest” in an evolutionary sense with self-interest in an ordinary sense[1].
> 
> When we call somebody “selfish” we have certain things in mind: screwing over others, not cooperating, being explicitly calculating in order to only maximize one’s own gain in interactions with others, hurting people for personal benefit, being untrustworthy, ignoring costs to others etc.
> We use the word to classify actions and those who perform them, and specifically to indicate disapproval.
> 
> That’s what we care about when we fear and dislike selfishness, and “genetic self-interest” is not this at all. It’s a completely separate thing, with an altogether different subject (genes, not people). We can and do have altruistic instincts and knowing how evolution created those won’t make them any less altruistic in any way we care about.

Nerst is also making a distinction between base- and [[mesa-optimization]]:

> In truth, insights into the evolutionary origins of altruistic behaviors tend to bother people because it gives the impression that apparently unselfish behaviors are “really” selfish, deep down. But they aren’t, and thinking that they are confuses our motives with the mindless optimization process that created those motives. This is very common and very bad.
> Our needs and wants are justified by their own existence, not by the hypothetical goals of the meaningless process that created them. I don’t care for my children because I’m on a mission to spread my genes. I love them. That love springs from how my brain is set up, and yes, I understand why it’s set up that way, but that doesn’t change how I feel.

[[Kevin Simler]] responds:

> The most important distinction between morally good people and morally bad people is whether they’re playing the sociopath strategy (exploitative, negative sum) or the prosocial strategy (cooperative, positive sum). Of course it’s probably more of a spectrum than a dichotomy, but that’s the main axis. Both strategies are genetically selfish, but that’s irrelevant: we still judge the sociopath as evil and the helpful neighbor as good, and we’re right to do so.

# A second defense

You have no doubt seen the meme where an astronaut, floating in space outside Earth's atmosphere, asks, "It's all X?" as a second astronaut, pointing a gun at him, replies "Always has been" as if ready to shoot. (Interestingly, the meme is not riffing on a scene from a movie, as it is typically assumed—and reasonably, since most memes do start with a real line of dialogue from popular culture. Rather, it merely seems a very plausible, generic scene from a space action movie, with plausible movie dialogue.) This is my view of communication as manipulation. 

Now there are two ways this can be taken. One is to take it conservatively: all communication is manipulation, but also, human communicative behavior is exactly as you already think it is. The claim does not imply more selfishness or more dishonesty in human conduct. It merely reframes what we already believe about human communication by conceptualizing it through the frames of outcomes, and pointing out that necessarily, outcomes of communication must use human beings as their medium. The second way to take such a claim is as more revisionary: Our motives are not what we thought. We are more outcome-motivated, and more performative than we like to think. We are constantly attempting to further goals and meet desires through our communications. We do not neutrally represent “the truth.” Our unconscious, expressed through words and gestures and choices of display, is constantly reaching out to manipulate others around us, even as our conscious is often innocent to these doings. I think the reality is a little bit of both. 

And crucially, in either situation, manipulation in service of goals is a factoring that is neutral to the desired goals. These goals can be ideological and selfless. They can be noble and pure of heart. We still must move minds and hearts to accomplish them, since by moving minds and hearts, we alter actions and thus the state of the world. Furthermore, one way of manipulating others is by telling “the truth,” which phrased more precisely is to say, by presenting a definition of the situation, or a representation of reality, you believe will instill an understanding in your audience which matches your own as closely as possible. And finally, we may advance “true” (believed) representations in order to harm others, and advance disbelieved representations in order to help others. Manipulation is meant here is value-neutral and agnostic, both with respect to the representation’s relationship to reality, and with respect to the goals that representation is advanced in service of. It is simply the only way we can alter agents behavior informationally (as opposed to via physical force). And the proportion of informational manipulation to physical force manipulation is much higher than we might think: when we beat a dog for begging, we do not physically prevent his begging in the future, rather, we create an informational association that alters his model of the world, such that the dog is averse to begging because he believes, as part of his world-model, that a beating will follow. True, purely physical incapacitation and alteration of each others’ behaviors is both rare and taboo in human social life.

As with any other strategic scenario, how cooperative or adversarial manipulation is is closely related to how long-term the interpersonal relationship is, and to the stance and proclivities of the speaker (which are non-trivially acculturated). Again, to argue that communication just is manipulation is not to say that our interactions are more adversarial than we typically suppose. Long-term alliances and relationships, which are crucial to the mental health and strategic efficacy of most most individuals, require that each participant produces (the impression of) comparative value to each other participant. In a sense, we could say that the manipulations must, in the long-term, be consented to, since by severing the bond of the relationship, the individual can free themselves of the manipulation's effects. Furthermore, whether an individual is viewed as trustworthy, in the sense of manipulating pro-socially, modifies how others respond, so that duplicitousness in the long-term is typically caught and penalized (e.g. through ostracism, another method of severing bonds). Crucially, the "official story" matters less than the "real effects": an individual who gives underhanded compliments, or finds ways to make others feel and act poorly, against the larger macro-picture of how these individuals would like to feel and act, will find themselves socially disconnected.

# Precise, vague, and generic utterances

When I say “All communication is manipulation,” it is sometimes protested that many utterances are advanced without a clear goal in mind.

The first issue here is that one need not hold a desired outcome consciously in mind in order for one’s behavior to be shaped by, attracted to, and in the service of a desired outcome. We are not transparent to others or ourselves.

But I will readily grant that many communicative moves do not have specific outcomes in mind (otherwise we would be constantly disappointed). Rather, utterances can be strategically aimed with varying levels of specificity or narrowness. I will carve these into three classes of goals: precise, vague, generic, and bespoke.

Precisely strategic utterances are uttered with a specific end result in mind—for instance, telling a police officer a lie in order to avoid a traffic ticket. There is a single, binary outcome kept in mind which is either met or not met.

Vaguely strategic utterances attempt to shift an interaction or situation toward a vaguely better situation, or away from a vaguely worse situation—for instance, avoiding certain topics in professional settings to avoid unspecified blowback, conflict, or disharmony. One steers with, and follows, the winds, instead of seeking a singular destination.

Finally, generically strategic utterances are those which are uttered for a large audience, attempting to achieve a number of vague or specific goals among the largest possible swathe of audience—for instance, presenting a consumer product as organic in order to increase its buyer appeal among certain demographics, or presenting a specific political front with the precise goal of winning an election. This is in contrast to what we might consider “bespoke” utterances.

Of course, generic and bespoke, vague and precise, lie on a spectrum. No utterance is crafted fully generically or totally bespoke. No desired outcome is perfectly specific or totally vague. In other words, manipulation is always value-neutral on certain axes. We may specifically wish to avoid a traffic ticket, but be agnostic as to whether the officer, during the traffic stop, makes small talk about the weather, his golden retriever, or the evolved origins of back pain. And even when we believe that our interactive desires are at their most open-ended, that we are perfectly agnostic to whatever response we might receive, we can easily find ourselves surprised, upset, enraged, or disappointed by the emotional tenor or semantic content of the response.
