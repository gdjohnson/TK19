Paul Graham:

> In every period, people believed things that were just ridiculous, and believed them so strongly that you would have gotten in terrible trouble for saying otherwise.
> Is our time any different? To anyone who has read any amount of history, the answer is almost certainly no. It would be a remarkable coincidence if ours were the first era to get everything just right.
> In essence: we can safely expect that there are many opinions that seem utterly heretical to us but that will become the "earth rotates around the sun" style facts a few generations ahead. But if we can safely say so, then the natural question is: why aren't we believing things already?
