# Bergson 1911: Matter and Memory

To Bergson, perception and one's past are co-terminous:

> Perception is never a mere contact of the mind with the object present; it is impregnated with memory-images which complete it as they interpret it.

One perceives _in order to act_, and one sees the world as a set of obstacles and affordances to the body:

> ...the body, always turned towards action, has for its essential function to limit with a view to action, the life of the spirit. In regard to representations it is an instrument of choice and of choice alone.

^ca93ac

> I have supposed that the office of the image which I call my body was to exercise on other images a real influence, and, consequently, to decide which step to take among several which are all materially possible. And since these steps are probably suggested to it by the greater or less advantage which it can derive from the surrounding images, these images must display in some way, upon the aspect which they present to my body, the profit which my body can gain from them... The objects which surround my body reflect its possible action upon them... The brain is concerned with motor reaction, not with conscious perception.

^86e333

And one _recognizes_ only in virtue of present perception's association with memory:

> It is alleged that the present perception dives into the depths of memory in search of the remembrance of the previous perception which resembles it: the sense of recognition would thus come from a bringing together, or a blending, of perception and memory. No doubt, as an acute thinker has already pointed out, resemblance is a relation established by the mind between terms which it compares and consequently already possesses ; so the perception of a resemblance is rather an effect of association than its cause.

# [[Kenneth Liberman|Liberman]] on Merleau Ponty "The Intertwining/The Chiasm"

[[Kenneth Liberman|Liberman]], illustrating this idea and reflecting on his studies of elite coffee tasting:

> When you drink the coffee, descriptors give you access to dimensions of the flavor and you can communicate those dimensions to other tasters... [you can] direct someone to find what can possibly be located with the use of that descriptor... __[it] is opening up the taste of the coffee but at the same time it's closing it down__, because once you categorize this basket of fruit... then how do you taste, you know, vanilla that's going on at the same time... Nobody's even attuning to it. You might not even sense it.

Thus, [[Kenneth Liberman|Liberman]] posits, "the tongue that tastes and the tongue that talks always accompany each other." The _logos_—our language and concepts—can't be separated from the phenomenon itself, as the phenomenon itself is shaped by language and concepts. (It is the interaction of a brain and an object, much like an art encounter.)

Merleau-Ponty sees a paradox: In veiling reality, we _unveil_ reality. In obscuring, we also _provide_. This is what it means to be "condemned to meaning." [[Kenneth Liberman|Liberman]]: "There's always more than you can describe" (_cf._ "excess of signification"). Merleau-Ponty: "This is not a paradox of man, but a paradox of being"—he is trying to get away from anthropocentrism, that this is merely a problem of perception and existence.

# Schütz, Phenomenology of the Social World

George Walsh, introduction to Schütz's _The Phenomenology of the Social World_, describing the influence of Husserl:

> What is primordially given to consciousness is an unbroken stream of lived experiences (_Erlebnisse_)—heterogenous qualities without boundaries or contours which wax, wane, and pass gradually into one another. The contents of this stream of consciousness have no meaning in themselves.

> All such lived experiences... are lacking in meaning and discrete identity. At the time they are actually lived through, they are not given to us as separate and distinct entities. However, once they have receded a slight distance into the past, that is, once they have "elapsed," we may turn around and bring to bear upon them one of the aforementioned Acts of reflection, recognition, identification, and so forth.

# Heidegger, Being and Time

Heidegger's is a corrective to Husserl's arguable individualism or subjectivism; he stresses _being in the world_ and _being with others_. His definition of phenomenology is object-oriented rather than solipsistic: "to let what shows itself be seen from itself from itself, just as it shows itself from itself." In other words, phenomenology to Heidegger is the attempt to gain access to the world in _spite_ of an interpretive structure, which will nonetheless always be there. [[Kenneth Liberman|Liberman]] calls this the "necessary impossibility of objectivity.

"Nothing stands outside the phenomena of phenomenology." Humans' natural tendency is to make sense, or make intelligible, the world via reference to existing high-level theories of origin and meaning, to integrate it with existing structures, but this creates closed ideological systems. [[ethnomethodology]] stresses, in the phenomenological tradition, that it can (and should) "describe" without theorizing or explaining. (An attempt to escape ideology, and again prevent projection.) Is this possible? [[Kenneth Liberman|Liberman]] isn't sure.

There is an "eagerness in their eyes" when coffee tasters aren't sure yet how to categorize a cup, when they're still figuring out the flavor, and that eagerness disappears as soon as it is categorized. (_cf._ Barthes on the jouissance of reading without a clear interpretive schema to impose.)

Heidegger's _befindlichkeit_ is often translated as "situatedness," "attunement," "feeling," "mood," and by [[Kenneth Liberman|Liberman]], as "finding oneself in an orientation/project." [[Kenneth Liberman|Liberman]] asks: is this situatedness subjective or objective? It involves feeling and orienting, but it is in _response to_ an object which is "impressing" itself on the subject. The object has the [[agency]]. It is best understood not dualistically but as _between_ wave and object, an interaction.
* [[Kenneth Liberman|Liberman]] likes the metaphor of "surfing": an interaction between subject and object the surfer acts on and with the wave. "You respond to where the wave or Internet sends you. You're not in charge."

# Rate-distortion theory

There are facts in the world; an organism cannoy fully encode these facts, therefore it must selectively choose and compress information on the basis of relevance to utility (costs or benefits of making or failing to make distinctions in the world).

# [[Kenneth Liberman|Liberman]]: The Phenomenology of Coffee Tasting

> Key to Husserl's analysis is the idea that the thing revealed is always revealed by means of these categorial objectivities that are projected upon the sense-data and thereby organize it. This phenomenon of projection, also known as intentionality (we actively "intend" the significance of a thing by interpreting it in the light of our way of understanding it) is perhaps phenomenology's most fundamental idea.

# Metonymic and pragmatic perception

## Chapman: In the Cells of the Eggplan

> In routine, practical activity, what we want perception to tell us is: what are the meaningful aspects of the situation we’re in right now? And what possibilities for ongoing activity do they suggest? 

> Much of what you see, you see as something. You don’t see a textured black region of the visual image, you see a loudspeaker. Or a raven. It’s already a loudspeaker or a raven when you first experience it.7 Bottom-up vision has done that work for you. What you see something as depends on your knowledge, context, and purposes. If you are familiar with moussaka and you see it on a plate in a restaurant, you’ll probably see it as moussaka. If you aren’t, you’ll probably see it as a mushy casserole. You can’t see it as moussaka, because that’s not part of your ontology.

> Because perception evolved to enable purposeful activities, most of the time it reveals meaningful functions and potentials. Those are a matter of ontology: not just categories, but also how you separate the world into objects; what properties you see them having; and how they relate to each other. It’s not just objects, but also intentions, actions, events, environments, and possibilities. In context, you see someone kneeling as worship; someone running out of a store as shoplifting; and items on a restaurant table as a dinner setting, not a silverware collection.

> Routine activity is easy because most of the time we can see what to do. We see affordances—cues as to what actions are possible, and what their effects will be. 

## Gary Klein 2011: Insight

> if you ever watch the Olympics and you watch a diving competition, the diver goes off the high board, and the TV commentators are there and the person didn't do a belly flop, dove in, looks clean, and they're saying, "Look at the splash. The splash was bigger than it should have been, the judges are sure to catch that", and what happened was the diver's ankles came apart just as she was entering the water. Then they show it in instant replay, and sure enough, that's what happened. But the commentator saw it as it happened. To a viewer like me, that's invisible. I just saw the dive. But they know where to look, and they know the probable trouble spots, or they know the difficult aspects. That's part of the patterns that they've built up -- to know how to direct their attention so they can see the anomalies. They see it as it's happening, not in replay. You can't tell somebody over the phone what to look for. You can say it after the fact, but they see it while it's going on. That ability to make fine [[discrimination|discriminations]] is a part of tacit knowledge, and a part of intuitive knowing.
