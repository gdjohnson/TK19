Pierre Bourdieu, Pascalian meditations (2000):

> But, above all, I had always been grateful to Pascal . . . for his determination, inseparable from that concern, always to seek the ‘reason of effects’, the raison d’être of the seemingly most illogical or derisory human behaviors—such as ‘spending a whole day in chasing a hare’—rather than condemning or mocking them, like the ‘halflearned’ who are always ready to ‘play the philosopher’ and to seek to astonish with their uncommon astonishments at the futility of common-sense opinions.

Postrationalism was never just “drunk rationalism,” but it was never a full-fledged system of belief either. Instead it was a sensibility, a nose with its own suspicions and inclinations, reverences and irreverences. 

But parts of the community were also marked a combination of an explicit political commitment to passivity/"let locals sort their own shit out," and an implicit “broken cultures/discourses/fields aren’t worth fixing” defeatism, alongside the general jadedness that results from being mismatched with the world but not high enough in executive function to bend it to you. All that means isolationism and "sloth."

From _The Future Primaeval_:

> (1)	Propositional belief is too narrow of a concept to model all desirable cognitive content. It is better to think in terms of a general continuum of forms of cognitive content: memories, models, heuristics, skills, procedures, habits, and such, with truth as a sometimes-applicable proxy for usefulness rather than an always-applicable end in itself.
> 
> (2)	Ideas about what's important and valuable are usually thought of as fundamental truths or moral axioms, but are often better modelled as shifting social fictions, local residue of larger-than-human social phenomena, tribal markers, and so on.

And Darcey Riley, writing in 2014 at _Yearly Cider_, adds, 

> As you might imagine, postrationality has a lot in common with rationality. For instance, they share an epistemological core: both agree that the map is not the territory, and that concepts are part of the map and not part of the territory, and so on. Also, the two movements share some goals: both groups want to get better at thinking, and at achieving their object-level goals.
> 
> But the movements diverge in the way that they pursue these goals. In particular, rationality tends to give advice like “ignore your intuitions/feelings, and rely on conscious reasoning and explicit calculation”. Postrationality, on the other hand, says “actually, intuitions and feelings are really important, let’s see if we can work with them instead of against them”.

*Perry 2015: Ritual Epistemology*

> Post-rationalists tend to value true beliefs, but have more sympathy for religion, [[ritual]], and tradition (including monogamy) than the rationalist community. They are skeptical of the ability of science (as it is practiced) to solve humanity’s problems and provide a sense of meaning or happiness. I am sympathetic to both groups. I view post-rationality as a kind of hyper-rationality: a concern with truth, efficacy, meaning, and human experience that is willing to be skeptical of even the foundational beliefs of the rationalist worldview.

> This is the post-rationalist critique: that irrational-seeming systems often serve the interests of people better than purely rational systems that attempt to dispense with ceremony... Religion and “woo” are not the only repositories of harm, and incorrect beliefs are not the only kind of harm.

*Perry 2016: Systems of the World*

> A recent article on demon possession illustrates my point. In this article, a psychiatrist explains why he believes in demon possession, using as evidence cold reading techniques and second-hand reports of parlor tricks. Someone well-versed in rationalism would immediately spot egregious epistemic problems. This is not postrationalism; this is prerationalism. Is belief in demons (and the [[ritual|rituals]] to eradicate them) interesting and worth studying, as a phenomenon and even as a metaphor? Of course! But accepting the literal reality of demons, and the effectiveness of techniques to eradicate them, uncritically, indicates a basic error.

*Chapman's attack on rationalism*

> Formal methods all require a formal specification of the problem. For example, before you can apply Bayesian methods, you have to specify what all the hypotheses are, what sorts of events constitute “evidence,” how you can recognize one of those events, and (in a decision theoretic framework) what the possible actions are. Bayesianism takes these as given, and has nothing to say about how you choose them. Once you have chosen them, applying the Bayesian framework is trivial. (It’s just arithmetic, for godssakes!)

# Radiolab 2019: There and Back Again

> LUCY COOKE: Well basically, there's an island off the coast of Panama where -- where the sloths have shrunk to half the normal size. And they live off algae in these mangrove swamps that's got alkaloids with a similar property to Valium. And so they're stoned dwarf sloths. It's an evolutionary cul de sac.

# Chapman's metarationalism

_See also [[Language]], specifically the section on nebulosity._

Chapman's "meta-rationalism" is an extension of the pragmatic tradition. Truth is not absolute but contextual and functional; categories and concepts are purpose-driven and structured by telos. Strangely, however, Chapman does not much acknowledge the American pragmatists:

> One might take as founding texts [of metarationalism] Heidegger’s Being and Time, published in German in 1927 and in English in 1962; [[Wittgenstein]]'s 1953 Philosophical Investigations; Kuhn’s 1962 The Structure of Scientific Revolutions; and Garfinkel’s 1967 Studies in [[ethnomethodology]]. Key later works include Kegan’s 1982 The Evolving Self and Schön’s 1983 The Reflective Practitioner.
