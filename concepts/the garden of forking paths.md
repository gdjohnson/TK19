# Borges: The Garden of Forking Paths

Tsun:

> I imagined [the labyrinth] infinite, made not only of eight-sided pavilions and of twisting paths but also of rivers, provinces and kingdoms... I thought of a maze of mazes, of a sinuous, ever growing maze which would take in both past and future and would somehow involve the stars.

The portrait of time Borges presents is not linear and "incompossible" (impossible + incompatible) but rather simultaneous. The Sinologist Albert tells our Dr. Tsun:

> Differing from Newton & Schopenhauer, your ancestor did not think of time as absolute and uniform. He believed in an infinite series of times, in a dizzily growing, ever spreading network fo diverging, converging and parallel times.

## Intelligence as optimization

In the Borges story, how does the narrator, Dr. Yu Tsun, describe the temporal development of his story? First, there are environmental factors: he comes to know things, or to be precise, make inferences which indicate a high possibility that, for instance, his life is in danger. First he discerns, through inference, the identity of the speaker at the other end of the line: "the voice that had spoken in German... was that of Captain Richard Madden." Look to how the narrator uses the verb _to mean_, in the sense of entailment:

> Madden, in Viktor Runeberg's office, meant the end of all our work and [...] of our lives also. His being there meant that Runeberg had been arested or murdered. 

From these inferences into the state of the world, assessments of _chance_ and _risk_, through _calculations_ of probabilities, he comes to make decisions which improve the likelihood of achieving his goal, here to survive long enough to communicate the location of British artillery to the German officers he reports to.

First he develops a _plan_; he thinks it "more prudent to take a cab," because it runs "less chance of being recognized." He ponders an "irrevocable decision," echoing the "irreversibility" of thermodynamics, and "calculates" the time before decisions must be made.

# Deleuze and Leibniz

## Tiergarten

Leibniz describes an academy of games in one of his more "science-fiction"-y texts, as Deleuze calls it, an academy of games which was also an exposition, a casino, a science academy, and a botanical garden. What kind of garden can we imagine it as? 

I've been to Tiergarten, the great Berlin garden that Benjamin speaks so fondly of in _Berlin Childhood_. I had taken LSD and seen Lou Reed, red and in shadows like his album covers, in the curvature of my urinal. I had wound up a brightly colored mechanical bird, the kind the vendors hawk in Paris, between the hedges of Tuileries. German gardens inherit a bit from the English, a bit from the French. There is the structuring, but also the sense of getting lost. How does Benjamin describe it?

> Not to find one’s way around a city does not mean much. But to lose one’s way in a city, as one loses one’s way in a forest, requires some schooling. Street names must speak to the urban wanderer like the snapping of dry twigs, and little streets in the heart of the city must reflect the times of day, for him, as clearly as a mountain valley. This art I acquired rather late in life; it fulfilled a dream, of which the first traces were labyrinths on the blotting papers in my school notebooks. No, not the first, for there was one earlier that has outlasted the others. **The way into this labyrinth, which was not without its Ariadne, led over the Bendler Bridge, whose gentle arch became my first hillside.** Not far from its foot lay **the goal**: Friedrich Wilhelm and Queen Luise. On their round pedestals they towered up from the flowerbeds, as though transfixed by the magic curves that a stream was describing in the sand before them. But it was not so much the rulers as their pedestals to which I turned, since what took place upon these stone foundations, though unclear in context, was nearer in space. That there was something special about this maze I could always deduce from the broad and banal esplanade, which gave no hint of the fact that here, just a few steps from the corso of cabs and carriages, sleeps the strangest part of the park.

## Simultaneity and time collapsed

In his 1980 lectures, Deleuze emphasizes, in Leibniz, a very similar vision to Borges, of different timelines in simultaneity: 

> The image of the labyrinth hounds [Leibniz]. He never stops talking about the labyrinth of continuity. This palace is in the form of a pyramid. Then, I look closer and, in the highest section of my pyramid, closest to the point, I see a character who is doing something. Right underneath, I see the same character who is doing something else in another location. Again underneath the same character is there in another situation, as if all sorts of theatrical productions were playing simultaneously, completely different, in each of the palaces, with characters that have common segments.

> "The Garden of Forking Paths," what is it? It's the infinite book, the world of compossibilities.

# Catastrophic bifurcation ("gate theory")

_See [[Gates]] entry._

# Schreiber & Umansky 2001: Bifurcations, Chaos, and Fractal Objects in Borges

## Determinism and chaos

> Successive bifurcations lead to an irregular and unpredictable time evolution of deterministic nonlinear systems, which is designated chaos.

Poincaré:

> It may happen that small differences in the intitial conditions produce very great ones in the final phenomena. A small error in the former will produce an enormous error in the latter. Prediction becomes impossible, and we have the fortuitous phenomenon.

> If prediction becomes impossible, it is evident that a chaotic system can resemble a stochastic system (a system subject to random external forces). However, the source of the irregularity is quite different. For chaos, the irregularity is part of the intrinsic dynamics of the system, rather than unpredictable outside influences. Chaos enables determinism and unpredictability to coexist in the same system.

## Time and space

Insofar as any temporal decision is made, a choice in response to a bifurcation, it "will leave a permanent imprint on the system by the selection" (quoting Prigogine, "Nonequilibrium"). The final state in a meaningful way testifies to the history, the path by which the system arrived.

Peitgen:

> When we examine the development of a process over a period of time, we speak in terms used by chaos theory. When we are more interested in the structural forms which a chaotic process leaves in its wake, then we use terminology of fractal geometry, which is really the geometry whose structures are what gives order to chaos.

# Commonplace

## Sylvia Plath, _The Bell Jar_:

> I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and [[Socrates]] and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.

## Manuel De Landa in interview with Erik Davis (2013)

De Landa touches on [[overhaulism]], [[complexity]], [[flux]], and empowerment:

> As they say, they key word here is not wisdom, but caution. You don’t know what happens at bifurcations. You have absolutely no control. The smallest fluctuation can make things go wrong. The predictive power of humans and technology is nil near bifurcations. All you can do is approach carefully, because the last thing you want to do is get swallowed up by a chaotic attractor that’s too huge in phase space. As Deleuze says, “Always keep a piece of fresh land with you at all times.” Always keep a little spot where you can go back to sleep after a day of destratification. Always keep a small piece of territory, otherwise you’ll go nuts.

> There might be an ethics here: how to live your life poised at the edge of chaos, how to allow self-organizing processes to take place in all the strata that bind you. In your life, you could create maps of attractors that bind your local destiny – those behaviors that are habitual and so on. And try to find those bifurcations that would allow you to jump, if not to complete freedom – that doesn’t exist – but to another set of attractors less confining, less binding, less stratifying. Or learn to lead your life near a bifurcation without ever crossing it – the lesson of being poised on the edge of chaos.

Chokepoint: a point at which all forking paths converge—must, necessarily, in order to advance. 

# Fractals

# Individuation

Individuation, following Simondon, is the process of making choices, committing to one phase of being over another, in a process of "becoming." The state of the chooser at any moment evidences the choices made, just as the state of the organism evidences the environmental selection pressures which evolved it (Good Regulator Theorem). Subtract environment from position and you are left with a disposition, the algorithm which chooses. The situation is complicated by the fact that one's experiences of choice, and of differing states, perpetually refines the choosing algorithm; the disposition does not merely act within the environment but is discovered _through_ action.
