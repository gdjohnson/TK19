*Noë 2015: Strange Tools*

> We need finally to break with the dogma that you are something inside of you—whether we think of this as the brain or an immaterial soul—and we need finally to take seriously the possibility that the conscious mind is achieved by persons and other animals thanks to their dynamic exchange with the world around them (a dynamic exchange that no doubt depends on the brain, among other things).

The pop studies scholar Simon Reynolds, in his book on glam _Shock & Awe_, sets the scene for us:

> This negative concept of the 'image' that spread during the sixties was part of a rowing view of public life as a realm of falsehood and facade. Against this rallied the conviction that 'the truth will set you free'—the motor behind nearly all the forms of bohemian expression and radical dissent that bubbled up during that decade. [...] Fellow travellers in America included Norman Mailer and Jackson Pollock, whose 'I am Nature' spontaneity splashed across his canvases (but also into the fireplace of his benefactor Peggy Guggenheim when he unzipped and urinated during a dinner party). Teenage Holden Caulfield in _The Catcher in the Rye_ rails constantly against the phoniness of grown-ups, a plaint echoed within a few years by Bob Dylan with "All is phoney."

> A double-bind game is a game with self-contradictory rules. The social double-bind game can be phrased in several ways: The first rule of this game is that it is not a game. Everyone must play... Be yourself, but play a consistent and acceptable role. Control yourself and be natural. Try to be sincere.
