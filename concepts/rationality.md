# James Wood, discussing DeWitt's Last Samurai for the New Yorker

> “Rational” is Sibylla’s favorite word, often repeated. Kurosawa’s film, she remarks, is essentially “about the importance of rational thought.” She advises her son that, having turned six, he is “old enough to act like a rational human being.” When Ludo bargains for ice cream, she warns him to try to “act as a rational human being.” Most people, Sibylla thinks, are habitually illogical: “They could probably be rational quite easily if they were properly taught.” But there is almost nothing rational about being a parent, beginning with the pure surplus of conception. And children and parents have a hard time agreeing on what is rational. If a child’s desire for ice cream is perfectly rational to a child, so is his need to know the identity of his father, or the reasons for his mother’s unhappiness. Behind “The Last Samurai,” shadowing it but subtly unmentioned, lies the failed project of John Stuart Mill’s highly rational upbringing. Mill learned Greek at the age of three—he was “properly taught”—but at twenty he doubted if he could go on living. In his “Autobiography,” Mill recounts a spiritual crisis that, he realized, his education had partly precipitated. Mill blamed his unhappiness on long habits of “precocious and premature analysis” that had steadily separated him from “the very culture of the feelings.” Discovering, at last, the salvation of Wordsworth’s poetry, Mill felt himself reconnected to natural beauty, and to “the common feelings and common destiny of human beings.” Ludo yearns for some of that precious commonality; his burden is to have a mother who is unable to weigh its importance.
