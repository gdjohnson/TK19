[3:20 PM] suspended reason:
These marks enable us to communicate with people who are beyond the reach of our voices, both in space and in time.
[3:21 PM] suspended reason: One idea I've been tossing around this server/my notes is that a crucial axis, for selection games and #[[surrogation]] problems, is between "[[distant evaluation]]" and "[[distant evaluation|proximate evaluation]]"
[3:21 PM] suspended reason: Machiavelli, in The Prince, makes a similar distinction but calling it figuratively "sight" and "touch"
[3:21 PM] suspended reason:
...a prince ought to take care that he never lets anything slip from his lips that is not replete with the above-named five qualities, that he may appear to him who sees and hears him altogether merciful, faithful, humane, upright, and religious. There is nothing more necessary to appear to have than this last quality, inasmuch as men judge generally more by the eye than by the hand, because it belongs to everybody to see you, to few to come in touch with you. 
[3:22 PM] suspended reason: Basically, a politician is "seen" from a distance by 99% of the population, and only a handful of folks actually exist in close, prolonged contact with him
[3:23 PM] suspended reason: That close, prolonged contact is where we get the truth about people—
[3:23 PM] suspended reason: (1) because it's incredibly costly and taxing to maintain an elaborate facade over the long-term (which is why in House of Games the conmen needed an exit strategy—it took everything they had to construct a false reality for Maggie)
[3:24 PM] suspended reason: (2) because there are no [[surrogation|surrogates]], you get to see the person respond to a huge range of situations, get to see how their responses fared in consequence, get to test and probe the person in conversation etc
[3:25 PM] suspended reason: But in [[distant evaluation]], using distant credentials and optics... Shit starts getting really degenerate, it's all about resumes, so people cheat on tests to get a good letter-grade, which gives them a good GPA, which looks good on a college app. It's all super compressive and super representational, which opens up opportunities to optimize for the representation—enter kids doing 6 extracurricular clubs and [[sports]] just for the resume line
[3:25 PM] suspended reason: Dating apps use [[distant evaluation]] more than in-person dating, which is the downside that accompanies the efficiency/time-saving upside
[3:26 PM] suspended reason: But you can never eliminate first dates because that in-person exposure is so, so crucial.
[3:26 PM] suspended reason: (See also the observation that relationship satisfaction with narcissists is really, really high at first, and then slowly tanks and leads to a breakup—they just can't maintain the facade, or don't want to)
[3:27 PM] suspended reason: So when Hayakawa talks about this symbolic nervous system we use, that lets us scale up, I can't help but think that despite its upsides, its all these downsides to [[distant evaluation]], distant reputations, etc that characterize many of modernity's problems—both institutionally and psychologically
