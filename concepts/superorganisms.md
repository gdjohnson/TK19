## Holland 2012: Signals and Boundaries

> Ecosystems, governments, biological cells, markets, and complex adaptive systems in general are characterized by intricate hierarchal arrangements of boundaries and signals.

> [At Hadrian's Wall, just like the Chinese Great Wall], there were unanticipated local effects [of the erected boundaries], such as trade and fairs at the portals. There is a kind of semi-permeability, reminiscent of membranes controlling the flow of resources into and out of biological cells.

> In Peru, small patches of rainforest exhibit the great variety of species typical of rainforests everywhere, but occasionally one encounters a lawn-sized patch almost entirely occupied by a single species of tree: _Duroia hirsute_. According to local legend, such "devil's gardens" are cultivated by an evil forest spirit. Until quite recently there were only conjectures about a natural explanation for these patches. However, there is a species of ant (_Myrmelachista schumanni_) that lives in small cavities in the monospecific trees occupying the "[[garden]]." We now know that the ants "weed" this "[[garden]]" by injecting formic acid into the seedlings of other plant species, much as if they were attacking another insect (Holldobler and Wilson 1990). The ants probably attack all seedlings that don't emit the scent of the favored tree. This signal detection is similar to the action of an immune system, which destroys all cells that don't send the "self" signal. By setting up this bounded niche, the ants create a locally ideal environment.

> Each of [a system's] boundaries is semi-permeable, permitting easy passage for some resources and difficult passage for others. This semi-permeability encourages local concentrations on resources.

On complex adaptive systems (CAS), of which superorganisms are a coordinating subset:

> The biosphere can be divided into geographical regions (e.g., tropical rainforest, temperate-zone woods), which in turn consist of niches (e.g. bromeliads, spring ponds), which are further divided into populations (e.g. frogs, snails, dragonflies, algae), and ultimately individual organisms. Multi-celled animals can be progressively divded into organs (e.g. heart, brain), organ components (e.g., heart muscle, prefrontal cortex), cells, and organelles. The global economic can [be] divided into national economics, then into industries of markets (e.g., coal, stell), firms, and production steps.

# Coordination

Ari Holtzman: "If you can't figure out why two organisms are cooperating, you're looking at the wrong level" (gene, meme, tribe, etc)

## Alexander 2020: Studies on Slack

> In the esoteric teachings, the inner layer of two-layer evolutionary systems is represented by the Goddess of Cancer, and outer layer by the Goddess of Everything Else. In each part of the poem, the Goddess of Cancer orders the evolving-entities to compete, but the Goddess of Everything Else recasts it as a two-layer competition where cooperation on the internal layer helps win the competition on the external layer.

## Dennett & Levin 2020: Cognition all the way down

Dennett & Levin set out with two primary goals. The first is to push back on scientists' "teleophobia"—a fear that to anthropomorphize non-human entities with concepts like "goals" and "[[intent]]" and "cognition" is to sentimentalize them unproductively. Instead, the authors argue that our avoidance of these human-like attributes is in fact hindering our best theories. They write, "the point is not to anthropomorphise morphogenesis–the point is to naturalise cognition"—to place it in an evolutionary continuum from the computation of cells to superorganisms. "Cognition has been a slow climb, not a magical leap." 

> individual cells are not just building "blocks," like the basic parts of a ratchet or pump; they have extra competences that turn them into (unthinking) **agents** that, thanks to information they have on board, can assist in their own assembly into larger structures

Crucially, it is computer technology that enables us to see how all this works, through analogy:

> because [cells] are voltage-gated current conductors, they are in effect transistors; and we already know how powerful transistors are as a basic element of memory, feedback loops (basic homeostasis or amplification), and coordinated decision-making. Cells have policies for joining up with other cells based on sharing nutrients and diluting toxins (a trick learned from the protobodies of bacterial biofilms), as well as sharing information that enables better predictions and thus homeostatic success. **In fact, they even gang up on dissenters in a process known as normalisation – any cell that is physiologically aberrant will experience the neighbours’ trying to bring it into the large-scale physiological plan by its neighbour cells simply trying to average its voltage (for example) via the gap-junctional connections.**

> If you agree that there is some mechanism by which electrically active cells can represent past memories, future counterfactuals and large-scale goals, there is no reason why non-neural electric networks wouldn’t be doing a simplified version of the same thing to accomplish anatomical homeostasis

The second goal is formulating a limited, bounded definition of "cognition" that does not include many of the other phenomena which we find, in humans, to be coupled with cognition.:

> Agents, in this carefully limited perspective, need not be conscious, need not understand, need not have minds, but they do need to be structured to exploit physical regularities that enable them to use information (following the laws of computation) to perform tasks, beginning with the fundamental task of self-preservation, which involves not just providing themselves with the energy needed to wield their tools, but the ability to adjust to their local environments in ways that advance their prospects.

> the cone cell's knowledge is myopic in the extreme. Its _Umwelt_ is microscopic. It's an idiot savant, with some amazing talents but no insight at all into those talents. But thanks to communication—signalling—with its neighbours, it can contribute its own local competence to a distributed system that does have long-range information-guided abilities, long-range in both time and space.

Superorganisms are born from informational, predictive, and behavioral coordination:

> When two cells connect their innards, this ensures that nutrients, information signals, poisons, etc are rapidly and equally shared. Crucially, this merging implements a kind of immediate ‘karma’: whatever happens to one side of the compound agent, good or bad, rapidly affects the other side. Under these conditions, one side can’t fool the other or ignore its messages, and it’s absolutely maladaptive for one side to do anything bad to the other because they now share the slings and fortunes of life. [...] This physiological networking fundamentally erases the boundaries between smaller agents, forming a kind of superagent in which the individual identity of the original ones is very hard to maintain. Of course, these boundaries aren’t anatomical, they’re physiological or functional – they demarcate computational compartments inside of which data flow freely, with massive implications from a game-theory perspective. **Information (memory) is now shared by the collective – indeed, that is a prime reason for connecting to your neighbour: you inherit, for free, the benefit of their learning and past history for which they already paid in metabolic effort.**

> The other amazing thing that happens when cells connect their internal signalling networks is that the physiological setpoints that serve as primitive goals in cellular homeostatic loops, and the measurement processes that detect deviations from the correct range, are both scaled up. In large cell collectives, these are scaled massively in both space (to a tissue- or organ-scale) and time (larger memory and anticipation capabilities, because the combined network of many cells has hugely more computational capacity than the sum of individual cells’ abilities). This means that their goals – the physicochemical states that serve as attractors in their state space – are also scaled up from the tiny, physiological homeostatic goals of single cells to the much larger, anatomical homeostasis of regeneration and development

> An important implication of this view is that cooperation is less about genetic relatedness and much more about physiological interoperability. As long as the hardware is good enough to enable physiological communication of this type, the exact details aren’t nearly as important as the multiscale homeostatic dynamics ensured by the laws of physics and computation

They close with a schema for classifying types of cognition according to a system's "cognitive horizon" in space-time:

> One way to categorise and compare cognitive systems, whether artificial or evolved, simple or complex, is by mapping the size and shape of the goals it can support (represent and work toward). Each agent’s mind comprises a kind of shape in a virtual space of possible past and future events. The spatial extent of this shape is determined by how far away the agent can sense and exert actions – does it know, and act to control, events within 1 cm distance, or metres, or miles away? The temporal dimension is set by how far back it can remember, and how far forward it can anticipate – can it work towards things that will happen minutes from now, days from now, or decades from now? Humans, of course, have very large cognitive horizons, sometimes working hard for things that will happen long after they are gone, in places far away. Worms work only for very local, immediate goals.

> **Tissues, organs, brains, animals and swarms (like anthills) form various kinds of minds that can represent, remember and reach for bigger goals.**

# Informational Mereology

Previous philosophical approaches to compositionality:

> Mereological universalism or extensional mereology is an abstract idea, defined in 1937 by Stanislaw Leśniewski and later by Henry Leonard and Nelson Goodman (1940). It claims that any collection of things, for example the members of a set in symbolic logic, can be considered as the parts of a whole, a "fusion" or "mereological sum," and thus can compose an object. Critics of this idea says that such arbitrary collections are just "scattered objects." A mind-independent connection between objects is needed for them to be integral "parts."

> Mereological nihilists, such as Peter van Inwagen and the early Peter Unger denied the existence of composites, seeing them as simples (partless entities) arranged to look like a composite object. For him, a table is "simples arranged table-wise."

The information metaphysics approach:

> Information provides a more fundamental reason than van Inwagen's for treating living things as integrated composites and not simply mereological sums of scattered objects. Furthermore, __it extends a true composite nature to artifacts and to groupings of living things because they share a teleonomic property – a purpose__. And it shows how some "proper parts" of these composites can have a holistic relation with their own parts, enforcing transitivity of part/whole relations.

# Abstraction

## Wentsworth 2020: Evolution, Goals, Abstraction

> It is an empirical fact that we can predict the day-to-day behavior of the world around us - positions of trees or buildings, trajectories of birds or cars, color of the sky and ground, etc - without worrying about the details of plasmas roiling in any particular far-away star. We can predict the behavior of a dog without having to worry about positions of individual molecules in its cells. We can predict the behavior of reinforced concrete without having to check it under a microscope or account for the flaps of butterfly wings a thousand kilometers away.
> 
> Our universe abstracts well: it decomposes into high-level objects whose internal details are approximately independent of far-away objects, given all of their high-level summary information.
> 
> It didn’t have to be this way. We could imagine a universe which looks like a cryptographic hash function, where most bits are tightly entangled with most other bits and any prediction of anything requires near-perfect knowledge of the whole system state. But empirically, our universe does not look like that.
