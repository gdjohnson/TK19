The very first compressive formalization was the construction of a numeric system, whose contemporary instantiation in base-ten roundings crystallized a cross-ector swathe of human behavior around it. The writer Tim Taylor discusses some version of this in his blogpost “Round Number Bias,” though the phenomenon is wider than there discussed.

Taylor reports that consumers often stop filling their gas tanks at rounded dollar amounts, or will give even-dollar tips to waiters; that [[sports|baseball]] coaches make decisions about players based on round-number cutoffs:

> [Pope and Simonsohn] find, for example, that if you look at the batting averages of [[sports|baseball]] players five days before the end of the season, you will see that the distribution over .298, .299, .300, and .301 is essentially even—as one would expect it to be by chance. However, at the end of the season, the share of players who hit .300 or .301 was more than double the proportion who hit .299 or .298. What happens in those last five days?


> They argue that batters already hitting .300 or .301 are more likely to get a day off, or to be pinch-hit for, rather than risk dropping below the round number. Conversely, those just below .300 may get some extra at-bats, or be matched against a pitcher where they are more likely to have success. Pope and Simonsohn also find that those who take the SAT test and end up with a score just below a round number—like 990 or 1090 on what used to be a 1600-point scale—are much more likely to retake the test than those who score a round number or just above. They find no evidence that this behavior makes any difference at all in actual college admissions.

We must take it further: Entire industries are ravaged by inflation because of round numbers, and it isn’t solely due to cognitive bias. In a cash-based business — a food stand, a convenience mart, a dollar pizza window — where customer and seller convenience alike mean time, and time means money, defying round numbers is expensive, giving change bad business. This is to say nothing of the way fixed-price chains in general have seen their profits ebb and flow according to the value of ten cents, a quarter, or a dollar, over the past century.

Cuisine is tyrannized in an adjacent sort of logic: Much like art is optimized for artist “doability” and disposition as much as it is the preferences of audiences, recipes are optimized as much for a dish’s preparation and preparer as for its consumption and consumer. Ease of recording, remembering, and measuring out a recipe affects the creation and transmission of a recipe (its fitness, in the evolutionary — rather than aesthetic — sense). Seven-thirteenths of a tablespoon might be a better amount of salt to add, but half a tablespoon will win out on the recipe sheet every time.

Round numbers become influential in [[sports]] punditry and fan followings; Nike’s recent bid to break the four-minute mile received much media hoopla; for decades prior, many believed the four-minute mile to be an unbreakable barrier, though why four minutes instead of 3:59 or 4:01 was the point human impossibility set in was never fully established. In the NBA, Westbrook’s triple-double average in the regular season won him the MVP award this season; I say this with no offense to Westbrook, but theoretically falling slightly short of double digits across four categories instead of three is a more impressive athletic achievement, but “slips through” the system of performance-tracking that the Association and [[sports]] fans have crystallized, a system built on round numbers cutoffs. In love [[sports]], one can imagine a difference, in dating prospects (outcomes), as well as online profile number-fudging (behavior reflecting an implicit belief in disparate outcomes), between two men each of 70.5 inches height—one, American, whose height is measured in  feet; the other, European, whose height is measured in meters?

This is only to illustrate the degree to which neutral, even banal, features of the cartographic or “reductive” system can lead to substantial changes in human behavior. Analog gradients _need _compressing and systemization; this the very function of structures, including language, as [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] details in “Truth & Lies”; this compression makes it _tractable_, which is to say. able to be handled and manipulated. But there is a dark side to this dark miracle, manipulability.

# [[Thomas Schelling|Schelling]] 1960: Strategies of Conflict

Round numbers can serve as Schelling points. 

> The numerical scale is too continuous to provide good resting places, except at nice round numbers like $200.

> In bargains that involve numerical magnitudes, for example, there seems to be a strong magnetism in mathematical simplicity... [a] tendency for the outcomes to be expressed in "round numbers"... [or] the frequency with which final agreement is precipitated by an offer to "split the difference."

From [[Sam Fussell]], _Muscle_:

> From what I could glean from the magazines, real builders, like Arnold, Bill Pearl, Lou Ferrigno—all of them had 20-inch necks, calves, and arms; 30-inch thighs; 60-inch chests.

From Gioia 2002, "Being Good Versus Looking Good: Business School Rankings and the Circean Transformation From Substance to Image":

> [After the advent of business school rankings beginning in 1988], significant changes have attended every business school that aspires to be declared a "top-10, top-20, top-40, or top-50" school by these two progenitors [Business Week and U.S. News] or their many subsequent emulators.
