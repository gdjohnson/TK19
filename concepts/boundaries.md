# Noë 2015: Strange Tools

*On autopoeisis:*

> Living matter is organized toward its own self-maintenance and self-production in the face of the physical processes that enfold and threaten to dissolve it. It is the distinctive feature of the cell, perhaps the minimum form of life, that it takes in energy from its surroundings and uses it not only to power itself, as an artifact takes energy from a batter, but quite literally to make itself, to produce itself and to establish and maintain the boundary (the cell wall) separating itself from the world around it.
