Kant's concept of the _noumenal_ is similar to Plato’s forms: a belief in _something_ beyond the material, beyond the access of the senses, which is more "real" than the world of sensory appearances. [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] called Kant a “sneaky Christian”: this belief in essences is _religious_, hence why neoplatonism could coincide so amicably with the Christian Dark Ages.

# Luigi Perissinotto 2003: Wittgenstein and Plato

> [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]'s dialogue/debate with [[Socrates]] is part of the broader one he was engaged in with that Platonism which, as he saw it, marked the entire course of Western philosophy, and which is characterized by the contraposition between two worlds: the supersensory (that "real world" destined, in the end, to become "a fable") and the sensory.

> The first, the supersensory world, is, as Heidegger characterizes it so acutely, that realm which "since Plato, or more accurately, since the late Greek and the Christian interpretations of the Platonic philosophy [...] has been considered the true and the actually real world"; the second, the sensory world, "is only the unreal this-worldly world, the changeable and therefore the merely apparent world [...] the vale of tears in contrast to the mountain of eternal bliss on the other side."
