# Simulacra and literalism

See [[Simulacra]] entry.

Only the first level of simulacra is "literalism"; all other levels are either affiliative (tribal) or ends-oriented (instrumental/manipulative).

# Chicken 2020: My Struggle with Literalism

Often, utterances are not meant literally but convey a social subtext, or else are enacted to bring about some effect in the world (and instrumental utterance style):

> Kids did this not just in existing power structures, but to establish coalitions. Elsie would say “Sidney smells like soup.” Amy would say, “I never noticed that…” and depending on who could attract the crowd a group would be formed. I would notice that Sidney smelled like soup that day, but that she didn’t smell like soup ever again, other times I thought to notice. It didn’t matter, because the people who would say, “I had a bowl of Sidney for dinner yesterday,” (and laugh hysterically) ended up bonding with each other. Elsie had created a powerful [[ritual]]. I was friends with Amy, who chose to stay in the group and make soup jokes. She very quickly normalized soup jokes, and didn’t seem to remember how this reality had been constructed. Was she being dishonest by neglecting to think about her words and reality? Or was she mostly just being dishonest to my questions?

> Of course, the answer is _neither_. Elsie was learning how to get what she wanted: friends, loyalty, prime-time playdates, prestige, and information. She didn’t have to say it to know it, and in fact she _couldn’t_ say it. 

The social and conversational ecosystem, crucially, is not _about_ sharing accurate information; it is about something very different, or much much more.

# Connotation vs. Denotation: A problematic frame?

## Interview with Jon Livengood

**Reason**: So your view is that [evaluative dimensions in the concept of causation are] not so much a bias as a part of the holistic concept itself.

**Livengood**: I vacillate about the following: There's this idea in a number of moral philosophers in the second half of the 20th century, especially, called a "thick ethical concept." Examples of thick ethical concepts are things like "cruel," where, when you say someone or an act is cruel, there is both a descriptive element and a normative evaluative judgment; you're saying it's bad in saying it's cruel. But these things are entangled in some way that prevents you pulling them apart in a nice way, and the thought is that causation claims may function like that. When you something is a cause, there is a descriptive and evaluative component, but these things are inextricably smeared or tangled together. And importantly, the language of bias is not really appropriate here, because that normative entanglement is part of the correct, proper function of the concept; the concept wouldn't be doing its full work were it not responsive to these evaluative, normative considerations.

**Reason**: One typical story that's told about linguistics is that words have denotations and connotations, and it seems like your picture of this smear, where there is no "grounding" other than usage, connotation and denotation either don't exist or are bad carvings. Maybe there's a core of the concept and variations between subcultures, but this idea of there being a strict "real" meaning and an associative ladenness that the concept picks up, that distinction doesn't make sense in your frame, what could you even premise that divisional claim on.

**Livengood**: If you're making that description, you have to be thinking in the engineering mode already, and then you can be as precise and prescriptive as you want, but it becomes a question of convincing people to use your tools.

# Precedents

## Thick Concepts

Since the mid-twentieth century, philosophical attention has been devoted to terms which are "thick," containing both neutral descriptive (or "conceptual") and evaluative-normative (or "pejorative/laudatory") content. "Selfish" is a thick concept while "bad" or "red" are thin (they are solely evaluative or solely descriptive, respectively). 

The term originates with Bernard Williams's 1985 _Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy_; Williams himself adapted the Ryle & Geertz's term. His frame is preceded by R.M. Hare's "primarily" and "secodarily" evaluative words, corresponding to thin and thick respectively.

## Loaded language

Williams's distinction between conceptual and evaluative meanings is preceded by Charles Stevenson's "loaded language" (1937) and "conceptual" vs. "emotive" meanings (1938, see [[Linguistic Conquests]]) and Frege's _Sinn_ and _Färbung_, sense and tone.

To understand how these function, we must first understand how evaluative and descriptive terms operate in their own right. Non-cognitivist philosophers believe evaluative terms are meant to "express and induce conative attitudes" (SEP), while cognitivists see them as descriptions of cognitive states. The distinction "facts" and "values," or _is_ terms and _ought_terms, are potentially promising. Williams describes thick concepts as both "action-guiding" and "guided by the world"; there is a way that reality grounds and constrains evaluative utterances (one could reasonably call "false" an accusation of selfishness, for instance) but is also taking a side in a way that is not purely objective. They are descriptions which carry value judgments.

## Orwell, "Politics and the English Language"

"Politics and the English Language" (1946) includes the excerpt:

> The word _Fascism_ has now no meaning except in so far as it signifies "something not desirable." The words _democracy_, _socialism_, _freedom_, _patriotic_, _realistic_, _justice_ have each of them several different meanings which cannot be reconciled with one another. In the case of a word like _democracy_, not only is there no agreed definition, but the attempt to make one is resisted from all sides. It is almost universally felt that when we call a country democratic we are praising it: consequently the defenders of every kind of regime claim that it is a democracy, and fear that they might have to stop using that word if it were tied down to any one meaning.
