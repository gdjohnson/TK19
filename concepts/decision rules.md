Alternatively called "selection conditions." Closely related to [[pragmatic ontology]], and the concept of teleological or pragmatic typification in [[ethnomethodology]]. 

Some precedent in the computer science and control systems concept of a "production rule," where IF condition holds, THEN action is performed (e.g. by thermostat when temp reaches a certain low). However, while production rules are automatic behaviors based on conditions in the world, decision rules are patterns of voluntary choices based on the appearance of subjects under consideration to the chooser.

The attempt to game decision rules can in some cases be called [[framing#Strategic conceptualization|strategic conceptualization]].
