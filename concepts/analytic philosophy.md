The analytic tradition is continuous with the linguistic turn, arguably beginning with Frege, which was itself a response to a dominant Hegelianism in the United Kingdom at the time. Even Frege's style would find influence: his _Foundations of Arithmetic_ consists of numbered paragraphs, a structure which would be taken up by [[Wittgenstein]] in his own writing. 

# Ordinary Language Philosophy

_aka "The Oxford School"_

OLP was a late phase of the analytic tradition, founded in [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s writings on language. It would dominate British philosophy from the 1930s-70s, including thinkers like [[J.L. Austin]].

Like analytic, it took its primary goal to be the clarification of our representational system, with the added belief that this effort would also clear up reality. It was also skeptical of metaphysics, seeing the natural tendency of philosophy toward the metaphysical to be a tendency it ought to curb. Contrary to much of analytic, it believed it could use "ordinary language" for this effort, ditching earlier attempts at formalization. 

# vs. Continental

Clark Glymour: 

> There is a larger reason I do not find the positivists embarrassing: the contrast case on the continent. The positivists, not just those two I have emphasized, wrote with scientific and liberal ambitions, and at least with a passing connection with mathematics and science; in a time in which philosophy on the continent was embracing obscurantism and vicious, totalitarian politics they stood for liberal politics. When National Socialism came, they left home and country, but not in some cases, as with Hempel, before helping to ferry Jews out of Germany. Compare Heidegger, whose defenses of National Socialism echo some of his philosophical views (the German language is, next to Greek, closest to “Being”) or Merleau-Ponty (Stalin’s mass murders were regrettable, but necessary to the advance of socialism.) Sartre sat out much of World War II as a Vichy professor, replacing a Jew who had been dismissed. There is no thinking in these people worthy of the title; Sartre’s work varies from sophomoric (Les Mouches) to a series of puns passing as profound (L’Etre et le Ne’ant). The heirs of their remoteness from analytic thought were LeCans and Derrida and Pol Pot. Their political heirs are English professors who remonstrate about sexual oppression, but have never guided a frightened woman through a mindless, aggressive crowd to a clinic. That’s embarrassing.

# And [[conceptual analysis]]

[[conceptual analysis]] (CA) had its "heyday in Oxford in the 1950s," with analytic philosophy, Sandin 2006 tells us—but is now  increasingly abandoned. In Muehlhauser 2013: "Train Philosophers with Pearl and Kahneman, not Plato and Kant," Jonathan Livengood comments that his graduate program (which included on its committee Machery and Glymour, opponents of CA and relatively heterodox thinkers in the philosophy community) strongly looked down on CA, and offered coursework in more progressive theories of concepts—thus there appear to be indicators that this paradigm is being left behind by the more progressive analytic programs.

[[conceptual analysis]] is heavily influenced, arguably birthed, by logical positivism. "The positivist partition of all sentences into observation sentences and theoretical sentences left room for only two kinds of kosher intellectual endeavor: science, which collects and systematizes observation sentences, and analysis, which systematizes the analytic rules that govern the use of all the other sentences," Braddon-Mitchell & Nola 2009 write.

From Margolis & Laurence 2019, SEP: 

> Paradigmatic conceptual analyses offer definitions of concepts that are to be tested against potential counterexamples that are identified via thought experiments... Many take [it] to be the essence of philosophy.
