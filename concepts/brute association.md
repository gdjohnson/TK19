Paglia: Sexual Personae—The Cancelled Preface:
![[_Sexual Personae_#^d1a476]]

_At the heart of snobbishness is a curation of associations. The idea of pathogen contamination metaphorically applied to the culture sphere._

Language itself may be merely an adaptation on top of a built-in "machinery for instituting associative bonds."

A C-level college paper, on a complex subject, is probably a good approximation of overwhelmed cognition, cognition that cannot handle the complexity of its subject matter. And what do C-level college papers look like? They look a bit like a GPT'd essay: all [babbling](https://www.overcomingbias.com/2017/03/better-babblers.html), no deep structure.



## James 1890: Principles of Psychology ("Reasoning")

One form of coherent cognition below reasoning, or concepts, is brute association (sometimes called "empirical thinking" by [[William James]]) and its subset of "recepts," or untheorized, sub-conscious proto-concepts.

Crucially, this kind of thinking is always of associated _wholes_; properties or qualities are not abstracted, rather, one whole is understood to go "with" (couple) another whole. 

> Where the sign and what it suggests are both concretes which have been coupled together on previous occasions, the inference is common to both brutes and men, being really nothing more than association by contiguity.

Another example of brute association, or "coincidence," and its difference from a theoretical, mechanistic understanding (see [[Cargocult]] entry for the confusion of coincidence for mechanism; see [[Reasoning]] entry for a discussion of mechanistic, causal, theoretical understandings):

>  I am sitting in a railroad-car, waiting for the train to start. It is winter, and the stove fills the car with pungent smoke. The brakeman enters, and my neighbor asks him to "stop that stove smoking." He replies that it will stop entirely as soon as the car begins to move. "Why so?" asks the passenger. "It always does," replies the brakeman.

### Recepts

Recepts are untheorized, sub-conscious proto-concepts. They are sub-conscious insofar as the ideational "comparing, sifting, and combining" of thought is performed "_for_ the conscious agent, not _by_ him" (Dr. G. J. Romanes). In such occasions, the "sign and the signified melt into what seems to us the object of a single pulse of thought." 

Romanes:

> Houzeau writes that while crossing a wide and arid plain in Texas, his two dogs suffered greatly from thirst, and that between thirty and forty times they rushed down the hollows to search for water. The hollows were not valleys, and there were no trees in them, or any other difference in the vegetation; and as they were absolutely dry, there could have been no smell of damp earth. The dogs behaved as if they knew that a dip in the ground offered them the best chance of finding water, and Houzeau has often witnessed the same behavior in other animals....

> Mr. Darwin writes: 'When I say to my terrier in an eager voice (and I have made the trial many times), "Hi! hi! where is it?" she at once takes it as a sign that something is to be hunted, and generally first looks quickly all round, and then rushes into the nearest thicket, to scout for any game, but finding nothing she looks up into any neighboring tree for a squirrel. Now do not these actions clearly show that she had in her mind a general idea, or concept, that some animal is to be discovered and hunted?’

Recepts are elevated to concepts only when they are _theorized_.

### Quoting JS Mill
> It is to this great law of association that we trace the formation of our ideas of what we call external objects; that is, the ideas of a certain number of sensations, received together so frequently that they coalesce as it were, and are spoken of under the idea of unity. Hence, what we call the idea of a tree, the idea of a stone, the idea of a horse, the idea of a man. In using the names, tree, horse, man, the names of what I call objects, I am referring, and can be referring, only to my own sensations; in fact, therefore, only naming a certain number of sensations regarded as in a particular state of combination, that is, concomitance. Particular sensations of sight, of touch, of the muscles, are the sensations to the ideas of which, color, extension, roughness, hardness, smoothness, taste, smell, so coalescing as to appear one idea, I give the name of the idea of a tree.

### Quoting a Mr. Bain
> External objects usually affect us through a plurality of senses. The pebble on the sea-shore is pictured on the eye as form and color. We take it up in the hand and repeat the impression of form, with the additional feeling of touch. Knock two together, and there is a characteristic sound. To preserve the impression of an object of this kind, there must be an association of all these different effects. Such association, when matured and firm, is our idea, our intellectual grasp of the pebble. Passing to the organic world, and plucking a rose, we have the same effects of form to the eye and hand, color and touch, with new effects of odor and taste. A certain time is requisite for the coherence of all these qualities in one aggregate, so as to give us for all purposes the enduring image of the rose. When fully acquired, any one of the characteristic impressions will revive the others; the odor, the sight, the feeling of the thorny stalk -- each of these by itself will hoist the entire impression into the view
