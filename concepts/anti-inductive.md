Anti-inductivity is closely related to [[common knowledge]]. 

From [[LessWrong]] Wiki:
> The standard theory of efficient markets says that exploitable regularities in the past, shouldn't be exploitable in the future. If everybody knows that "stocks have always gone up", then there's no reason to sell them.

# Yudkowsky: Markets are Not Anti-Inductive
> There was a time when the Dow systematically tended to drop on Friday and rise on Monday, and once this was noticed and published, the effect went away.

> Whatever is believed in, stops being real.

> To get an excess return - a return that pays premium interest over the going rate for that level of riskiness - you need to know something that other market participants don't, or they will rush in and bid up whatever you're buying (or bid down whatever you're selling) until the returns match prevailing rates.

## Comments

Will Pearson:
> All competitive situations against ideal learning agents are anti inductive in this sense. Because they can note regularities in their actions and avoid them in the future as well as you can note regularities in their actions and exploit them. The usefulness of induction is based on the relative speeds of the induction of the learning agents.
> As such anti induction appears in situations like bacterial resistance to antibiotics. We spot a chink in the bacterias armour, and we can predict that that chink will become less prevalent and our strategy less useful.

Liron:
> "markets are anti-inductive" means "markets act to lower the Bayes-score of low-entropy probability distributions over future asset prices".

Zanglebert:
> The _inductive_ element of markets is related to, and perhaps equivalent with, what traders or technical analysts traditionally call _momentum_.
> It is the tendency of market participants to look for patterns, find and observe them at their beginning, then to act upon it, and thereby, strengthening it.
> The _anti inductive_ element is what traders and analysts refer to as _return to mean_.
