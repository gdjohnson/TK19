# Hayakawa 1939: Language in Thought and Action

> Human beings are the _talking_ animals. Any theory of human survival that leaves this fact out of account is no more scientific than would be a theory of beaver survival that failed to consider the interesting uses a beaver makes of its teeth and flat tail.

## Language as creating an extended nervous system

Language, by creating a signaling system between boundaried agents, hooks us up into an extended nervous system:

> If someone shouts at you, "Look out!" and you jump just in time to avoid being struck by a car, you owe your escape from injury to the fundamental cooperative act by which most of the higher animals survive: namely, communication by means of noises.

> Indeed, most of the time when we are listening to the noises people make, or looking at the black marks on paper that stand for such noises, we are drawing upon the experiences of others in order to make up for what we ourselves have missed... These marks enable us to communicate with people who are beyond the reach of our voices, both in space and in time.

> Socities, both animal and human, might almost be regarded as huge cooperative nervous systems.

This, of course, leads to greater [[evaluation distance]], which increases [[surrogation]] problems.

> Human beings, then, are never dependent for information on direct experience alone. Even those in a primitive culture can make use of the experience of neighbors, friends, relatives, and ancestors, communicated by means of language. Therefore, instead of remaining helpless because of the limitations of their own experience and knowledge, instead of having to rediscover what others have already discovered, instead of exploring the false trails others have explored and repeating their errors, they can _go on from where others left off._ Language, that is to say, makes progress possible.

## Strategic language

> Once in a while [the ordinary man] is struck by the fact that some people (although he never includes himself among these) “twist the meanings of words,” especially during the course of arguments, so that words are often “very tricky.” Occasionally, too, he notices, usually with irritation, that words sometimes “mean different things to different people.” This condition, he feels, would be cured if people would only consult their dictionaries oftener and learn the “true meanings” of words. He knows, however, that they will not—at least, not any oftener than he does, which is not very often—so that he puts this down as another instance of the weakness of human nature.

Among the pitfalls of language use include:

> The fact that the implications of one set of terms may lead inevitably into blind alleys while the implications of another set of terms may not; the fact that the historical or sentimental associations that some words have make calm discussion impossible so long as those words are employed; the fact that language has a multitude of different kinds of uses, and that great confusion arises from mistaking one kind of use for another
