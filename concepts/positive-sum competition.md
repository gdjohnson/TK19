[[Steven Moore]], _History of the Novel_:
> This was the highwater mark of Andalusi literary production. [[Ibn Hazm]] wrote _Tawq al-ḥamāma_ [_The Dove's Neckring_], a classic of Arabic love literature. His cousin, [[Ibn Shuhayd]], composed _Risalat al-tawabi’ wa-l-zawabi_ [_Treatise of Familiar Spirits and Demons_], in which he embarks on an imaginary journey to interview the creative demons of poets and prose writers from the past and cites his own poetry and prose to prove his artistic superiority.

[[A.O. Scott]]: 
> [Bad reviews are] a kind of dopamine rush. First of all, editors—especially editors at _The New York Times_—love it... And they're fun to do because they give you access to a lot of writerly tools... You can be funny. You can be clever. What you're doing is, you're demonstrating your superiority to a thing that you're writing about.

## Competitive Coordination ("Selfless Selfishness")
    
The general principle behind much of [[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]]'s sociological writing, _distinction_, once seen cannot be unseen. It is the idea that a huge portion of human energy is devoted to setting the self apart. [[Keith Johnstone]], in _Impro_, calls these [[status]] games, adding that even sufficiently bizarre and eccentric maladies can be a mark of specialness; theatrical performances that leave out status games, he note, feel woefully incomplete to the point of breaking realism. The conversations are blander, somehow lack their usual implicit stakes of reputation.

At its best, social [[status]] is a way of incentivizing individuals to work for the benefit of the larger group. This "selfless selfishness," as in [[capitalism]], is not an inherent property of markets, but an an opportunity of them; incentives must be properly aligned.

Writing, art-making, scientific discoveries look like competition because they are: winners of these [[games]] are awarded social [[status]] or [[capital|prestige]] (which is accompanied by increased [[soft power]], increased social, romantic, and sexual opportunities, and increased influence). The manifesto-aping [[modernism|modernists]] were often ridiculous, looking like one of those shitty jpegs repeatedly screenshotted and compressed to the point of pixelation, but the ethos also organized young men into productively warring bands, each trying to outdo the other.

### [[Artworld]] Incentive Structures
    
If the [[artworld]] is broken, it is not because the broad contours of individuals' behavior have changed much; the jockeying for space and visibility, to place oneself in the form's telos, the attempt to better one's contemporaries and ensure a place in history books, is a human constant. It must be therefore that the __[[incentive]]__ structure, the structure of production, consecration, and discourse is broken.

## Competition & Autonomy
    
A [[field]]'s pertinence to, and interest among, the larger culture, correlates strongly (indeed causes) the level of competitiveness or cooperation among members of the field.

[[Simon Reynolds]], on contemporary electronica:
> Indeed, there is something of an audio-visual arms race going on within what the writer Geeta Dayal mischievously dubs “the festival-industrial complex”: musicians competing with each other not just to wow audiences but for places on the lineups. Festivals increasingly look not just for someone who can deliver a slamming DJ set or sonically stunning performance, but for world-exclusive premieres of a new show that impacts with the avant-garde equivalent of razzle-dazzle. “The idea of going onstage with a laptop and lighting done by some person you’ve never met before—that just doesn’t make any sense at this point,” says Gamble. “The expectation is a lot higher than that.”

### Gender & the [[artworld]]
    
If [[art]] has traditionally been warfare—one-upmanship, competition, and sexual display—the [[gender]] and ethos shift (likely correlated) of the later 20th and early 21st centuries may signal a significant transformation of approach.

### [[Criticism]]
    
Criticism is part of the articulation and dialectic of goals, what ought or ought not to be rewarded. A problem is solved with references to 1) goals and 2) [[rules|constraints]]; the relationship between them dictates the context of a solution.

Public [[shame|shaming]] and conferences of [[status]] are incredibly powerful tools which can and are abused, but if properly organized form the building blocks of group health. It is important to remember however that our conference is largely unconscious: disgust reactions, outgroup shaming, weaponized shame as sublimated aggression, rewarding behavior (healthy or unhealthy) with admiration, deference, sex.
