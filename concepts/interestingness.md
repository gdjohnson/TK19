Perry, "Why Books Are Fake":

> Interestingness is not a fixed property, but a [[games|_move_]] in a _conversation_ between what everyone in the audience already knows (the “assumption ground“) and the surprise reveal. Being interesting means that the audience shares, or can be made to share, the common knowledge that the author seeks to undermine. Interestingness is a function of whatever body of knowledge is already assumed to be true. Therefore, it can be difficult to see the interestingness – the point – of a fragment of an alien conversation.

The art world is grounded in the interesting. Much of knowledge work is grounded in the interesting. Much of discourse is grounded in the interesting. Boringness is a kind of redundancy, a predictableness. Information is "a difference that makes a difference"; the uninteresting is not even information. Some intellectual schools are more interested in building a map that best fits the territory. Others prefer provocation, novelty, and subversions to "mere" description—opening instead of closing, generating questions rather than answer them.

[[torque epistemology|Signals]] are seen as boring; [[torque epistemology|correctives]] are seen as interesting.
