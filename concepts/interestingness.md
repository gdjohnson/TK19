The art world is grounded in the interesting. Much of knowledge work is grounded in the interesting. Much of discourse is grounded in the interesting. Boringness is a kind of redundancy, a predictableness. Information is "a difference that makes a difference"; the uninteresting is not even information. Some intellectual schools are more interested in building a map that best fits the territory. Others prefer provocation, novelty, and subversions to "mere" descriptionâ€”opening instead of closing, generating questions rather than answer them.
