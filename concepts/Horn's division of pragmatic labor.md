> When a marked (relatively complex or prolix) expression is used, when an alternative (simpler) expression is available, this is typically interpreted as conveying a marked message which the unmarked, simpler alternative would or could not have conveyed.

> Informally, the reasoning can be described as follows: If John stopped the car in a regular way, (4a) is an efficient and truthful statement for Sally. Also, if Robin assumes (4a) to be true, it is a good guess that John actually stopped the car in a regular way because this is the most likely scenario. So (4a) is to be pragmatically strengthened to “John stopped the car in a regular way.” If John stopped the car in an irregular way, (4a) would therefore be misleading. Therefore Sally will consider (4b) instead, because this is the cheapest non-misleading message. Likewise, Robin will infer from hearing (4b) that (4a) was apparently inappropriate (because otherwise Sally hat chosen it). So if (4b) is true and the implicature of (4a) is false, John must have stopped the car in an irregular way. Hence (4b) is pragmatically strengthened to “John stopped the car in an irregular way.”
