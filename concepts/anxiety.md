Anxiety is [[predictive processing|predictive]] uncertainty; anxiety that is verbally unjustifiable is often subconsciously processed tail risk. It becomes pathological or problematic when its calibration to real risk and likelihood become chronically distorted, perhaps due to a general self-perception of precarity or danger. Since purpose and preference are the grounds for making a decision, a lack of either can lead to a lack of grounds, and thus an inability to decide, further fueling anxiety.

The anxious person is stuck in a combination of incentive and fear formally termed an "approach/avoidance conflict." The anxious actor becomes passive, avoidant, and inhibited.

Anxiety disorders may well be a disorder of the [[predictive processing|predictive]]  logic, the assignment of fear to tail risk, [[uncertainty]], or uncertainty, though it is unclear how much the mere alignment with a predictive paradigm adds to our understanding. Dominik Bach's work suggests that there is a real correlation between the possibility of reward and the manifestation of anxiety: a certain wariness accompanies, like an aura, good fortune, a protective anxiety born of loss aversion. (One is reminded, reading his papers, of a housecat who looks around every few bites of his canned tunafish, or a lion keeping an eye to his periphery as he pulls out an entrail.) Can we help but speculate that a certain material comfort in modern society, a local stability combined with knowledge of global and historical _instability_, might drive an anxiety epidemic?

Anxiety can be conceptualized as the corollary of [[creepiness]].
