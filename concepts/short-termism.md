Different strategies flourish in the short and long-terms. Weeds thrive in short-term settings; trees and forests outpace them eventually, but come in much later after a clearcutting.

Contemporary employment patterns, where white-collar employees climb the ranks by jumping laterally between organizations, creates bad incentives whereby short-term attractive, long-term disastrous moves can be "kept ahead of" by leaving a company, role, or department before it "blows up." As Taleb has argued, this increases the taking-on of tail risk.

Short-termism is one of the major patterns of human prejudice; long-termism is one of the things healthy cultures must teach children, and one of the things children learn by long trial and error. Bluffing, weasling, and deception (that, is [[opticratics]] broadly) is more successful in short-termist settings, because maintaining illusions in open settings (as opposed to controlled, closed settings) is tremendously difficult:

[2:12 PM] cwgoes: What about a second-order sense, are there processes, e.g. in markets, which use a longer-term selection pressure to create short-term selection pressure to pick costlier (harder-to-fake) signals?
[2:13 PM] cwgoes: Arguably this is true to some degree in hiring, especially for companies with short lifecycles and high talent-dependence, mostly thinking of tech here, companies which pick bad signals will hire bad talent & be selected out, similar dynamic.
[2:14 PM] cwgoes: Here you see a fair amount of divergence from standard signals (degrees, formal credentials) + some alternative signaling mechanisms arising (code bootcamps), but also just a lot of direct custom assessments (interview problems).
[2:15 PM] cwgoes: Is the most salient difference between that case and e.g. metrics by which politicians running for government office are chosen just one of timescales?
[2:16 PM] cwgoes: There is long-term selection pressure on societies/countries of course, but it operates rather slowly...
[2:17 PM] cwgoes: Is it possible to replicate this "surrogation-counterveiling selection pressure" in any way other than natural selection, at the mercy of whatever timescales are involved? Can it be designed somehow?
[2:27 PM] suspended reason: I have read that short-term CEOships are a big problem right now in the industry
[2:27 PM] suspended reason: the incentive structure toward short-termism leads CEOs to come in, puff up stats over a few years at the cost of long-term growth, so their resumes are padded for the next round of interviews, and then move on to a bigger company. 5 years later the company they just left is hurting, but on someone else's watch

[2:37 PM] [[thechickenman]]: The whole education system is set up to be measured on short-term outcomes convenient for the state while giving little attention to potential blind spots, peripherals, and long-term hazards.
[2:38 PM] [[thechickenman]]: The short term effects? You might be able to boost test scores. As Scott [Alexander] notes, "nothing in the logic of the scientific method itself seems to require that a short-run perspective prevail".

[11:47 AM] suspended reason: Thinkin bout what I might call "city" vs "town" dynamics and coordination
[11:49 AM] suspended reason: City dynamics: highly anonymous, assessment games characterized by "distant" and surrogated evaluation, there's a heavy reliance on credentials and other portable symbols, inter-personal reputation games are often short-term (people move neighborhoods and jobs constantly)
[11:50 AM] suspended reason: Town dynamics: everyone knows each other, Dunbar-sized communities, long-term and intimate/proximate mutual exposure (less reliance on representations, more experience with "the thing itself"), what we might call "ecological co-presence" between players
[11:51 AM] suspended reason: There are obviously "town" subcultures within "cities," and when you do enter an institution, you'll typically be subject to more "town" type dynamics than city dynamicsâ€”but the larger talent pool the institution poaches from, and interfaces with, is often characterized by city dynamics
