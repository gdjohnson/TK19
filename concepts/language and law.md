The rule of lenity holds that, insofar as a law is ambiguous, the court must apply it mercifully (i.e. in a way favorable to the defendent). This rule extends underlying values of Western justice systems including the "beyond a reasonable doubt" burden and "innocent until proven guilty" presumption.

# Textualism

Textualism is a stance toward law that argues we should only consider the words of a bill _as passed_ (rather than making speculations as to the [[spirit vs letter|spirit]] or [[intent]] of the lawmakers). 

The case for textualism is surprisingly strong. For one, a Constitutional provision or Congressional law is not the product of a single designer, with a spirit of [[intent]], but rather the result of a dynamic process within a committee of rivals. A bill must pass both chambers of Congress and then the Executive chair; at each stage, there will be voters or drafters with very different intentionalities or interpretations of the wording of the law being passed. Textualism is, in this frame, a pragmatic avoidance of this chaotic, distributed intentionality in favor of the one common source of truth: the actual letter of law as written and passed. How can we meaningfully speculate, in such a system, what Congress "means" or "intends," when the reality is a kludge of meanings and interpretations loosely coordinated by the text-at-hand?

A second case for textualism is that is prevents bad incentives. If a lawmaker or coalition of lawmakers can create a public impression of the [[intent]], or spirit, of a law, which exists _separate_ from the actual impressions of the voting and drafting representatives, and this intent or spirit is used in court cases, an incentive is created for strategic representation of bills in order to sway future court cases. 

Third, a textualist might appeal to public transparency of meaning, in the vein of the Stele of Hammurabi. A population must be able to transparently know the rules of the game they are playing. Oliver Wendell Holmes: "We ask, not what this man meant, but what those words would mean in the mouth of a normal speaker of English, using them in the circumstances in which they were used ... We do not inquire what the legislature meant; we ask only what the statutes mean." How they are understood is, from this perspective, more important than the [[intent]]—since individuals will act according to the law as understood (and not as intended).

Fourth, a textualist might note that, even if textualist rulings lead to an improper execution of Congressional spirit, a future Congress may always alter the wording of the laws in order to better represent said spirit. In this way, there is a cybernetic system of alignment between spirit, letter, and extension (application): spirit is turned to letter, which is applied; if the outcome down not match the Congressional spirit, the letter may be updated, and so on.

Judicial activism is sometimes used as a pejorative term for anti-textualists, but I am yet unaware of a more neutral, broad category for [[intent|intentionalist]] (or spirit-based) legal interpretation.

# Originalism vs The Living Constitution

Constitutional originalism asserts that constitutional clauses must be interpreted based on the understanding at time of enactment. The concept of a Living Constitution stresses that we must re-interpret the Constitution through contemporary contexts, and sometimes argues that originalist [[intent]] is inaccessible. Originalism more generally argues for the interpretation of law either as intended at time of enactment ("original intent") or as understood textually at time of enactment ("original meaning"); this is the reigning Originalist view among conservative justices like Scalia, Thomas, and Barrett. There are also divisions in originalist intent theory between the intentions of authors vs the ratifiers—mirroring textualist arguments about Congress as a "committee of rivals" with differing intents.

# Legal QAing

Insofar as we can think of the [[spirit vs letter]] problem as a surrogative problem whereby there is an intended function and an actual function, the legal problem of ambiguous language shares many relevant qualities with the programming problem of writing robust algorithms.

Programming deals with these problems via QAing: many possible test cases are drafted up, with human experts brainstorming edge cases and possible problematizing situations. Then, the actual results (extension) of the algorithm are compared to its intended function, and the letter (code) is updated until there is [[alignment]].

One possible objection is that under-specification, in laws, is crucial to the bill passing at all: representatives will be unable to agree on specifics, or too pressed for time to analyze them. Instead, this process of testing is punted to individual departments, bureaucrats, eventually the court system, etc. Rather than being done in advance—i.e. "tested" before "going live"—the bill's language is merely unleashed and dealt with ad-hoc.

# Federal Analogue Act

## U.S. vs Forbes

U.S. vs Forbes is a 1992 case centering around the grammar and sentence structure of the Federal Analogue Act. The clause in question reads:
> (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the term "controlled substance analogue" means a substance --
> (i) the chemical structure of which is substantially similar to the chemical structure of a controlled substance in schedule I or II;
> (ii) which has a stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system that is substantially similar to or greater than [such effect] of a controlled substance in schedule I or II; or
> (iii) with respect to a particular person, which such person represents or intends to have a stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system that is substantially similar to or greater than [such effect] of a controlled substance in schedule I or II.

The defendant contended that this was a two-pronged definition, (i && (ii || iii)). The government contended it was one-pronged, (i || ii || iii).

> Defendants contend that this section requires a two­pronged definition. The first prong requires a substantially similar chemical structure. The second prong requires either a substantially similar effect on the human nervous system or the intent to have such an effect. The government argues that a substance may be an analogue if it satisfies any of the three clauses. I agree with defendants.

> The government's reading of the analogue definition has superficial appeal. As a matter of simple grammar, when an "or" is placed before the last term in a series, each term in the series is usually intended to be disjunctive. Under this reading, AET would be an analogue if it satisfies any of the three clauses. However, this reading ignores other grammatical principles that apply in favor of defendants' construction. The operative segments of clauses (ii) and (iii) both begin with the word "which", signaling the start of a dependent relative clause modifying a precedent noun.

> If I adopt the government's construction and read clause (ii) independently, alcohol or caffeine would be controlled substance analogues because, in concentrated form, they can have depressant or stimulant effects substantially similar to a controlled substance. Likewise, if I read clause (iii) independently, powdered sugar would be an analogue if a defendant represented that it was cocaine, effectively converting this law into a counterfeit drug statute. In both cases, a defendant could be prosecuted for selling a controlled substance analogue even though the alleged analogue did not have chemical structure substantially similar to a schedule I or II controlled substance. Therefore, to prevent this unintended result, clause (i) must apply to any substance that the government contends is a controlled substance analogue.

## U.S. vs Washam

U.S. vs Washam rested on the meaning of structural similarity. Washam had imported and sold 1,4-Butanediol, a GHB analogue, from Mexico into the United States; he was arrested by an undercover offer after making a five-digit deal for the substance. Expert testimony in favor of the government pointed out structural similarities between 1,4 and GHB ("both linear compounds containing four carbons") as well as the conversion of 1,4 into GHB. Expert testimony in favor of Washam argued that the two chemicals occupy different "functional groups," used by chemists to differentiate chemical structures, properties, and reactivity—as well as the argument that MSG, a legal food additive, also metabolizes into GHB in the body.

> Washam argues that there is no consensus in the scientific community regarding whether 1,4-Butanediol has a “substantially similar” chemical structure to GHB under provision (i) of this definition, and thus the definition is unconstitutionally vague as applied.

# U.S. v Marshall

## David Strauss 2007: The Anti-Formalist

### Case background

> "Well, what if anything can we judges do about this mess?" Judge Richard Posner asked that question midway through his opinion in United States v Marshall.' The question, and the fact that he asked it, tell you as much about Posner as any answer he might give. If the law is a mess, then that is something judges should notice. They should not pretend that there is no mess, or that the mess is always someone else's (such as the legislature's) problem. And, if possible, they should try to improve the situation.

> The issue in Marshall was whether blotter paper impregnated with the illegal drug LSD counts as a "mixture or substance containing" LSD. The question matters because the weight of the "mixture or substance" generally determines the offender's sentence. A dose of LSD weighs almost nothing compared to blotter paper or anything else that might be used in a similar way (such as gelatin or sugar cubes). If the weight of the medium counts, a person who sold an enormous amount of pure LSD might receive a much lighter sentence than a person who sold a single dose contained in a medium. Also, the per-dose sentences for sales of LSD would bear an arbitrary relationship to the per-dose sentences for sales of other drugs, because the LSD sentences would be, for all practical purposes, a function of the weight of the medium.

The majority ruling held that blotters were "a mixture or substance containing" LSD, and therefore part of its weight. "Judge Posner's dissent argued that the "mixture or substance" language should be interpreted not to include the medium, because the majority's conclusion led to irrational results-indeed results so irrational that they would be unconstitutional if the statute were not construed differently."

> Treating the blotter paper as a "mixture or substance containing" LSD produces results that are, according to Judge Posner and Justice Stevens, who dissented in Chapman, "bizarre," "crazy," and "loony."" Selling five doses of LSD impregnated in sugar cubes would subject a person to the ten-year mandatory minimum sentence; selling 199,999 doses in pure form would not.

### Formalism and anti-formalism

Posner described the disagreement as a conflict between "the severely positivistic view that the content of law is exhausted in clear, explicit, and definite enactments by or under express delegation from legislatures" and a more pragmatic view of interpretation. Strauss calls this positivistic view "formalism": that "legal problems can be solved in a quasi-mathematical way." "Judge Posner," he writes, "has never allowed what then-Judge Cardozo called 'the demon of formalism' to **'tempt the intellect with the lure of scientific order.'**" The Judge, rather, is one of the "great anti-formalists of our time."

The Supreme Court used dictionaries to define "mixture," coming to the conclusion that a blotter fit the definition ("a 'mixture' may ... consist of two substances blended together so that the particles of one are diffused among the particles of the other") and that this was sufficient for their ruling. And yet, Strauss writes, this dictionary definition has little to do with normal English use of the word mixture, which would never call a water-soaked piece of paper a "mixture" of paper and water, or a piece of paper soaked in salt water and dried, with the salt crystals remaining, a "mixture" of salt. 

Taking a positivist, or "formalist" approach, ends up with pragmatically bizarre outcomes:

> What about the individual who is interrupted by the police while he is in the process of manufacturing an illegal drug, so that he is found in possession of a "mixture" of the drug and various precursors and catalysts. Would the entire mixture count? What if some of the other chemicals are toxic, and would never be sold to or ingested by a user? Would it matter if the "mixture" might in principle be sold to another manufacturer who could continue the process? Some courts of appeals have ruled that "only usable or consumable mixtures or substances can be used in determining drug quantity"" for sentencing purposes. That approach again essentially looks past the language of the statute and relies on Congress's concern with the marketing of the drug. But other courts of appeals have tried to follow what they characterized as the "plain language" approach of Marshall and Chapman and have concluded that the entire package, including the precursors and catalysts, is the "mixture" for sentencing purposes." On linguistic grounds, that view is hard to resist. But then an offender's sentence might vary by decades depending on whether the police interrupted him before or after he took the chemicals off the shelf and combined them.

> The Supreme Court used dictionaries to define "mixture," coming to the conclusion that a blotter fit the definition and that this was sufficient for their ruling.
