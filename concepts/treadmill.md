# Transcripts

[3:50 AM] suspended reason: Trying (very clumsily and naively) to think about the difference between set points, treadmills, and derivatives
[3:51 AM] suspended reason: I think people slip between them a fair bit and there might be some important differences you don't wanna elide
[3:52 AM] suspended reason: Set points can, I guess, be further broken up into a rolling average set point (e.g. most drug tolerance) and a "highest peak" set point
[3:53 AM] suspended reason: Whereas by derivatives I mean roughly, situations where difference between events/stimuli, or rate of change over time, acceleration etc matters more than absolute values
[3:54 AM] suspended reason: I think treadmills can refer to either case potentially?
[3:54 AM] suspended reason: And sometimes it's unclear to me whether things are about "difference"/leaps or about set points/tolerances. e.g. hot showers being amazing when you've been wearing the same clothes camping in the snow for a week
[3:55 AM] suspended reason: Maybe there's some underlying mathematical similarity between derivatives and set points that I'm missing out of innumeracy?
