Arthur Jafa, interview, on how curating many instances or images can bring out the shared subject of interest:

> for example, you have an apple. Are you attracted to the fruit? You put a firetruck, a red wagon next to it. You need three things that are red to realize it's not an apple, it's not a fruit you're attracted to, you're attracted to red. You need the three things to create a Venn diagram... The process of compiling things is more or less about getting at what I'm actually interested in.
