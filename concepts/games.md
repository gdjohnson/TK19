_See also [[Strategic Interaction]], which cases human life as a game._

1.  We do not know whether life “is” a game. What a question! What answer is there besides popular assent? We cannot even propose a definition of game. Wittgenstein has already shown the fruitlessness. C. Thi Nguyen, in attempting to define a game for his philosophical work, has provided a second, albeit unintentional and negative, example.
2.  But we think that casting life, and its sub-scenarios—conversations, parties, job applications, courtships, projects, collaborations, etc—as a game is fruitful because there are several qualities of games which these scenarios share.

Different kind of games are amenable to different: moods, worldviews, strategic styles. 

## Sacred spaces

### Pfaller 2014: On The Pleasure Principle
> Huizinga describes the increased intensity of affect that play generates as ‘sacred seriousness’. This sacred seriousness – the fascination, the extreme involvement and celebratory affect that is initiated by play – is at work in all forms of culture, including religion, art and sport. Huizinga thus concludes that _play presents the origin of all culture_. Huizinga even sees religious cults as especially a consequence of the ‘sacred seriousness’ yielded from play. ‘Sacred seriousness’ communicates one of play’s fundamental operations in establishing spatial and temporal borders –between the playing field and its environment, between the length of the game and the time beyond it. This demarcation establishes the decidedly celebratory atmosphere, and the greater involvement of participants as well as spectators – which also applies among religious cults. The particular affective conditions of religions are also the result of such spatial and temporal demarcations. Huizinga therefore concludes: ‘The hallowed spot [is essentially] a playground.’ 

This idea mirrors that of the [[sporting vs herding]] distinction in discursive styles:

> One style, Alastair writes, is indebted to the Greco-Roman rhetorical and 19th C British sporting traditions. A debate takes place in a ”[[heterotopia|heterotopic]]“ arena which is governed by an ethos of adversarial collaboration and sportsmanship. It is waged in a detached and impersonal manner, e.g. in American debate club, which inherits from these older traditions, you are assigned a side to argue; your position is not some "authentic” expression of self. [Alastair:]

> This [[heterotopia|heterotopic]] space is characterized by a sort of playfulness, [[ritual]] combativeness, and histrionics. This ‘space’ is akin to that of the playing field, upon which opposing teams give their rivals no quarter, but which is held distinct to some degree from relations between the parties that exist off the field. The handshake between competitors as they leave the field is a typical sign of this demarcation.

## Gamification

### Nguyen 2020: Games As Agency

Gamification's habit of _value capture_ is Nguyen's carving of [[surrogation|Goodhart's Law]], with an added emphasis on the way the simplified value structure of a metrics can become psychological internalized. 

Two types:
- intentional gamification: e.g. FitBit
- accidental gamification: e.g. academic life & research metrics (citation rates, impact factors)

To Nguyen, real life is analogue, games are discrete, and he's worried about a reduction in the transfer. Where our usual motivations and values are subtle landscapes, difficult to see or know fully, gamifications turns complex individual or organizational values into clear, explicit metrics.

> academic life has recently come to be ruled by quantified metrics for research quality—like citation rates and impact factors. These metrics may not have explicitly been designed to produce gamification among researchers. Conceivably, they arose from the bureaucratic need to collate information, or in university administrators’ quest to make more objective-sounding decisions about faculty hiring and promotion. But the clear, simple, and quantified nature of such metrics can also foster game-like motivations. Metrics, after all, look a lot like points. They offer some of the pleasures of games when we pursue them wholeheartedly. (_see also [[Against Academia]]._)

Much of the text is a reinvention of Goodhart:

> Theodore Porter suggests that, in general, quantification trades informational richness for usability (Porter 1995, 1-72). Quantified measures strip away context. On the one hand, context-stripping reduces the rich informational content at hand. On the other, it makes the information that does remain easily comprehensible and usable across many contexts. it makes the information easy to aggregate.

> as Porter notes, it is precisely because of this context-stripping that such quantified measures appear more objective than they actually are. GPA presents itself as an objective measure, but it is typically generated through a complex and frequently subjective processes of evaluation—but those processes are hidden in the final numerical product. For this reason, porter suggests, quantified measures are often used by administrators to disclaim decision-making, or at least to claim that some action was taken on the basis of some external and objective evidence.

The clearer and simpler an original target is, the less loss there is in such reductions, so that language acquisition can be gamified in a less lossy manner than, say, writing essays.

#### On optimizing for appearances as "gaming the system"

> In fact, we have a term for when people make choices that are aimed, not at the actual goal of an activity, but at manipulating the external measures of that activity’s success. The colloquial term is “gaming the system.” For example: the US News and World Report strongly weights retention rates. But retention rates can be gamed—for example, by refusing to admit high-risk students, who might have benefited the most from education.14 Students can game their GPAs by choosing easy courses, rather than courses that might provide the most educational benefit. But value capture is something more than just gaming the system. Gaming the system occurs when people intentionally exploit the gap between the measure and the value, usually for their own ends. Value capture occurs when they internalize that imperfect measure and so transforms their ends.

#### Heuristic drift

> Consider what we might call _heuristic drift_. Our values are many and complex. Most of us value our own happiness, our various projects, the flourishing of various communities and institutions we are involved in, and more. The individual values are often subtle to apply, and the mass of them is even more difficult. In order to cope with this, we often use _heuristic principles of action_ or heuristic expression of value—simple principles and representations, which can be readily applied in situations.18 We need such heuristics to manage in everyday life. If we always had to reason keeping in mind our full range of values, in all their richness and complexity, we would never be able to act. Thinking and deciding are resource-intensive activities. We use heuristics to cope with the complexity of our value system and the complexity of the world. The choice of heuristics should be governed by two considerations: accuracy and usability.

### Bogost 2014: Why Gamification Is Bullshit

_Bogost unites Frankfurt's technical "bullshit" with the concept of gamification._

## On games' relation to [[narrative]]

### Nguyen 2020

> Recall that [[narrative]], according to Nussbaum, can contribute to our moral development, because [[narrative]] can transmit practical wisdom through the expression of well-tuned emotions.

Games are “double-edged” to Nguyen, which really just means they're a neutral technology that can be used to a variety of ethical ends. Just like [[narrative]] can be the Nussbaum steelman cited above, or "malicious propaganda," gamification’s [[agency]] can empower us to our benefit or harm.

Like fictional or cinematic narratives, an awareness of fictionality, and the emotional detachment of _viewing_ rather than _being within_ means the kind of traumatic exposure we'd expect from similar events witnessed in real life does not here occur:

> awareness of the fictional status of events in game events seems [empirically; Young 2014] to block most of the psychological after-effects—just as awareness of the fictional status of events in film and television seems to block most of the psychological after-effects of viewing the violence in those media."

# Bahgwat: Playiing Games to Leave Games

Bahgwat sees game-like environments as having the following properties:

> * A few, all-important, game periods. The vast majority of time is spent preparing for the big day.
> * Static ruleset and domain. Proposed rules changes, even small ones, provoke huge debate. 
> * Highly structured practices; focused on skill development. 
> * Videotaped competition, allowing for the aforementioned technique retrospective.
> * Extremely quantified success — starting with the overall team win/loss statistics to five to ten statistics for each individual player. The greater the quantifiability of results, the fiercer the competition.
> * (Generally) zero-sum. If I win, you lose, and vice versa.
> * On-the-field / off-the-field distinctions are often invoked around questionable behavior
> * Time flows in season/off-season cycles.

# Games as a metaphor for communication, art, representation

See also Sontag's [[aestheticsOfSilence]], which argues that since all utterances are situated, all utterances are created and understood dialectically/dialogically:

> A genuine emptiness, a pure silence, are not feasible—either conceptually or in fact. If only because the art-work exists in a world furnished with many other things, the artist who creates silence or emptiness must produce something dialectical:  a full void, an enriching emptiness, a resonating or eloquent silence. Silence remains, inescapably, a form of speech (in many instances, of complaint or indictment) and an element in a dialogue.

## Pfeilstorch publication overview, May 2020

Casting human social activities as games has been one of the most productive frameworks for our community thus far. Here, we hope to give a brief overview of our research the past 12 months: what we have turned up, how it ties together, and why it matters. ([Link to publications](https://theinexactsciences.github.io/).)

In a game, a move derives its fundamental quality from a combination of (1) the history of moves which precede it, making up the “game state”; (2) the set of socially enforced constraints participating players must appear to adhere to; (3) the goals of players from macro to micro. Note that in #2, we stress the appearance of adherence over adherence itself: since most social games are refereed primarily by other players, rather than natural law, the reality of a move often does not matter as much as its apparent reality. In poker, cheating players win by avoiding detection; in the hiring process, talented workers are regularly overlooked in favor of talented bullshitters. This is the “[[opticratics|opticratic]]” quality of social activity—it is as much the _appearance_ of merit as merit itself which leads individuals to win games. There are exceptions: domains where activity is rewarded _irrespective of human assessment_, but these are rare and diluted by opticracy—medicine, stock prices, science, and many other games where players butt up against hard physics are still deeply permeated by the tyranny of optics.

Our most recent paper, “[[Discursive Games]], Discursive Warfare,” builds off the work of “[[erisology]]” blogger [[John Nerst]] and the social theorists Bruno Latour and [[Pierre Bourdieu]]. It argues that our beliefs, both publicly advocated and privately felt, are deeply situated and in a sense “reactionary.” The purpose of our public opinions, which is more clear in light of an evolutionary history of small hunter-gatherer bands, is not to have some ideal, “perfectly accurate” stance which corresponds to our best assessment of reality, but rather to _influence_ decision-making processes. In other words, our beliefs are goal-oriented and transformative. Perhaps the best metaphor for this approach is bargaining: in informal economies, sellers will initially offer far lower prices than they are willing to pay, in order to bring down the eventual compromise price. Similarly, many espoused political stances are more radical than their advocates. There are several pieces of evidence that point to this being the case: first, individuals frequently “switch sides” depending on who they are arguing against. Second, many proponents of seemingly radical views will quickly equivocate when privately questioned. In liberal camps, we have seen this recently with calls to abolish police, or in denials that there are any biological bases to sex differences. Advocates for the former typically carry policy goals of ending private prisons, funding restorative justice programs, and removing firearms as standard-issue police tools. Advocates for the latter typically believe that biological differences are overstated and weaponized against women.

None of this is especially ground-breaking; in a sense, we are merely stating that political actors rhetorically (read “strategically”) overstate the strength of their beliefs, while adding a Bob Trivers spin and claiming that these overstatements do not _feel_, phenomenologically, like rhetoric. But we argue that similar trends permeate academic and theoretical work as well. As [[Richard Rorty]] writes in _Consequences of Pragmatism_:

> When dialectical philosophers are accused of idealism, they usually reply as Berkeley replied to his critics—by explaining that they are only protesting against the errors of a certain philosophical school and that they are really not saying anything at which the plain man would demur. As Austin said in this connection, “There’s the bit where you say it and the bit where you take it back.”

This discursive inclination, coupled with what we call “the [[telephone effect]]”—the tendency of originally subtle academic arguments to become diluted or exaggerated by successive waves of popularization—leads to discursive battles being waged against “[weak men](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10503-010-9199-y).” That is, critics assault the real, stated views of at least _some_ advocates of a position, while avoiding its strongest arguments—either because they have only encountered the weaker versions, or because the weaker versions are more easily assailable. Many are familiar with Franz Boas’s claim that the Eskimos have “50 words for snow”; many are also aware that such a claim has been repeatedly falsified by anti-Sapir-Whorfists. Far fewer know that Boas never _did_ advance such a claim. His field work found only that Inuit tribes appeared to have _more_ fine distinctions for types of snow than did Anglo societies, but the repeated, motivated exaggeration of his finding by pro-Sapir-Whorfists lead to the “50 words” narrative dominating linguistics—a claim easily rebutted by anthropologists hungry for a high-profile take-down. Only recently, after many decades of such viewpoints being widely dismissed in linguistics, has broad empirical work suggested that Boas’s original, more modest claim was perfectly accurate.

“[[Discursive Games]], Discursive Warfare” walks through many cross-domain examples of similar effects, from Freudianism to feminism and literary theory. Given this “battle of weak-men,” we belief that a more synthetic approach is necessary to make forward progress on inexact science problems, one which seeks out the strongest, original arguments for various scholarly camps, and then treats them non-dichotomously, as reconcilable, “three blind men” perspectives on the elephant. We call this “general compatibilism,” after our belief that the most compelling resolution of the free will/determinism debate is a compatibilist approach which re-conceptualizes the problem such that both positions are, in some meaningful sense, true.

Our recent case study, “Situating LessWrong in Contemporary Analytic Philosophy,” puts this approach to the test by working through the hostile, mutual suspicion between analytic philosophers and LessWrong rationalists. Examining in detail a set of philosophy-of-language issues which both camps have written extensively on, we find that, despite their apparent disagreements, the two sides have, in recent years, independently come to very similar conclusions and beliefs about the nature of language.

Earlier, we mentioned that we see beliefs, and discursive utterances, as transformative “moves” in a public decision-making game, which are best understood not so much in a “vacuum” but as situated ploys to accomplish certain desired outcomes. We think that all communication, in a similar way, is fundamentally goal-oriented. The goal of this supplementary material is to gain grant funding, and almost all linguistic decisions that have gone into it at some level are shaped by this desire. 

Coming to everyday communication through an enactive “games” lens, we have coined the phrase, “All communication is manipulation; some manipulation is mutually advantageous.” Despite the negative connotations of a word like “manipulation,” we mean it in a very neutral sense, in which linguistic communication is fundamentally an _action_: something designed to change one’s circumstances. But whereas actions can be wielded against nature, e.g. lifting a rock, communication only works with other humans (and in some cases, other intelligent non-human animals). If a goal is a delta between one’s present and desired situation—_I wish to have a candy bar_—then my social interaction with a cashier is designed to “manipulate” the cashier into selling me the candy bar. Of course, in many communication situations, this manipulation is perfectly transparent and consensual, because it is mutually desired by both parties: the cashier knows that I am trying to provoke a sale, just as my friend knows, when I shout his name, that I am trying to gain his attention.

While developing this framework for communication, we came across the 1960s work of [[Erving Goffman]] (1969, _Strategic Interaction_) and [[Thomas Schelling]] (1960, _Strategy of Conflict_). We realized that, for a brief, decade-long window, this kind of open-ended, strategic approach to social communication had been introduced and then promptly forgotten. In “[Axes of Strategy](https://www.pfeilstor.ch/-89/axes-of-strategy-part-1),” an in-progress forum investigation of strategic interaction, we attempt to rekindle the currently démodé approach, showing how much premises of commitment, coordination, and deception undergird everyday linguistic use.

In these social games, there are typically “evaluated” and “evaluator” roles. (In many, symmetrical interactions, each person occupies both roles depending on whose turn it is.) In such assessment games, there is the obvious, aforementioned advantage of deception—that an evaluated party will definitionally accomplish more favorable outcomes if he can create an impression for the evaluator that serves his interactional goals (regardless of whether that impression “matches” reality). But, we realized, especially in more formal and institutional evaluation settings, this style of deception takes a backseat to a more pernicious problem, which we call either “[[surrogation]]” (when befalling an evaluating party) or “degenerate play” (when performed by the evaluated). In social games of assessment, the evaluating party looks for “cues” or [[surrogation|proxies]], with which he can make larger inferences about the individual’s quality, character, motives, background, etc. Clothing, linguistic style, or the prompts in a grant application are such [[surrogation|proxies]]—because we can never know the “full” situation in all its relevance to our own evaluation goals, we must discover and interpret metonyms which statistically correlate with harder-to-discern qualities. In economics, this is often known as the distance between private and public information. But digging into literature from sociology, statistics, game studies, artificial intelligence research, signaling theory, accounting theory, counter-insurgency, and many more fields, we discovered that such a concept had been invented many times over. The structure of each discourse’s in-house concept was roughly similar: some metonymic cue, which correlated with a “deeper,” desired quality, became fetishized by evaluators, who lost sight of its role as purely a [[surrogation|proxy]] and began to treat it de-contextually and automatically, as valuable in-itself. At the same time, the evaluated players, realizing that they would be rewarded more for the appearance of these metonyms than for actually possessing the qualities such metonyms imply, began optimizing toward the metonyms themselves, re-allocating effort away from real problems and into appearances. 

This paper, “[[surrogation]],” brought us, finally, to the divide between a game’s spirit and its letter. Many incentive structures become perverse, and many laws become unjust, precisely because of how difficult it is to specify the spirit of a game—the intended way that players ought to participate, or ought to _avoid_ behaving as—in concrete, literal law. In gaming communities, both of board and video games, the tendency for players to exploit the poorly written “letter” of games is called “degenerate play.” We explore these game dynamics in our short piece “Spirit vs. Games,” beginning with the lessons of King Midas, who underspecified his desire for gold and was cursed by this failure. The underspecification problem, of course, is one of the most notorious in artificial intelligence, and will require a much deeper understanding of how formal representations of reality—for instance, language—are interpreted and “signify” in different contexts and by different players.

In other words, we believe that for many of our most crucial problems—from artificial intelligence to economics to law—it is language—and our failure to understand language in all its complexity—which holds us back. Linguistic meaning may seem a narrow problem at first—an issue best relegated to literary theorists, perhaps. But we believe that it is the most widespread instance of a larger class of representation problems which are fundamental to all coordination between entities.

# Bourdieu

## Is a Distinterested Act Possible?

> Illusio is the fact of being caught up in and by the game, of believing the game is "worth the candle," or more simply, that playing is worth the effort. In fact, the word interest initially meant very precisely what I include under the notion of illusio, that is, the fact of attributing importance to a social game, the fact that what happens matters to those who are engaged in it, who are in the game... it is to recognize the game and to recognize its stakes.
> 
> Social games are games that are forgotten qua games, and the illusio is the enchanted relation to a game that is the product of a relation of ontological complicity between mental structures and the objective structures of social space.

# Mutual exclusivity of games

@Chaosprime, Twitter: "All real problems are at least double binds because problems that aren't, you can just fucking solve."

Participation in multiple games is often mutually exclusive. This mutual exclusivity can be de jure: the host or proprietor of one game prohibits (binary) as in federal laws against simultaneously serving on private company boards and public agencies, or penalizes (continuous) participation of players in another game, as in the 90s/2000s penalization of academics who blogged. Or, the mutual exclusivity can be de facto—limitations of time, geographic space, and energy.
