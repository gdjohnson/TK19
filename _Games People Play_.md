Berne sees social interaction as characterized by various games. One of the primary purposes of these games is "stroking"—to receive a certain kind of egoic recognition by a conversant. I might call this pursuit of pleasure [[surrogation]] insofar as it is a marker of community standing, respect, alliance, etc which we seek out in a way which can become decoupled from what it stands for. Alternatively, we can think of strokes as a way of warding off doubt and nihilism, of sustaining belief: "A movie actor may require hundreds of strokes each week from anonymous and undifferentiated admireres to keep his spinal cord from shriveling, while a scientist may keep physically and mentally healthy on one stroke a year from a respected master."

Interactions between individuals, and the incidents which arise in them:
> superficially appear to be adventitious, and may be so described by the parties concerned, but careful scrutiny reveals that they tend to follow definite patterns which are amenable to sorting and classification, and that the sequence is circumscribed by unspoken rules and regulations. These regulations remain latent for as long as amities or hostilites proceed according to Hoyle, but they become manifest if an illegal move is made, giving rise to a symbolic, verbal or legal cry of 'Foul'! Such sequences, which in contrast to pastimes are based more on individual than on social programing, may be called _games_. Family life and married life, as well as life in organizations of various kinds, may year after year be based on variatoins of the same game.

Berne puts great stock in both the "social patterning" and "ulterior restrictions and motives" of these games—the sense of hidden attempt and agenda.
