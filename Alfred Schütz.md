alias: Schütz

[[Kenneth Leiter]] frames Schütz as an ethnomethodologist, although he is not typically considered part of (but rather a forebearer of) that tradition.

In addition to his work in phenomenology, Schütz worked as a banker, lawyer, and economist. He was a student of [[Edmund Husserl]] and attempted to apply Husserl's phenomenological thought to sociology. His major intellectual project was the investigation of how social reality is constructed by members of a society.
