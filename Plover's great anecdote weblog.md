You've seen what's called the "Kentucky Bend" region of Tennessee, yes?

The Ohio river has moved (drastically, due ot an earthquake once), so there's this little thumb of Kentucky that is landlocked on 3 sides by Tennessee, and on the north by the Ohio river

and so that little thumb has no telcom service (like you can't get the phone line to run you a phone, because the TN one won't do work in KY, and the KY on can't lay line across the river

(it matters less now that there' s cellphones, but that entire several hundred acres of land became just farmland with no houses on it because people couldn't get phone line

The thing with recorded contra music vs live contra music is
a: recorded cd tunes are like 3 minutes, you need 10 minutes to dance to
b: most folk bands never wind up with the upfront capital (or patience or desire?) to sit in a recording studio

controversial point c: bands and dancers are actually interacting in realtime, band senses dancer zest and amps up zest levels in the played music, in a feedback loop of (whatever the dance, the tune, the dancers, and the dance being called suggest). Thus a band recording in a studio is missing 2 major ingredients of "what normally makes their tunes great in a dance hall.

observation: ice fishing fulfills the courtyard pattern 

you build a little shanty village every day with huts (if you're fancy) or chairs (if you're not) around a central courtyard that is divided between tipups, and a fox&goose track for the toddlers to run in 

so adults are facing in both to monitor the food-gathering, and the 'the kids aren't falling in the hole or getting too cold'ing 

and you pack the whole village out of your truck in the morning and back into your truck after sunset so you get to build a perfect fresh village each day 

(fox&goose also a brilliant innovation really: you stomp or scrape a big wheel-with-spokes into the snow, and the kids play tag but the rules are you can't get off the scraped pattern; this means kids will never fall into the fishing gear) 

(also "don't put your footprints outside the stamped pattern" is the kind of rule that children love and will self-enforce) 

(I don't mean 'none of them will step outside the lines' but I mean 'when someone steps out of the lines, the other kids will say HEYYYYYYYYY and stop playing until the defector is following the rules again)
