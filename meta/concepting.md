# Okrent 2010, _In the Land of Invented Languages_

Pre-17th C, mathematicians and scientists could only write about mathematics in sentence and paragraph form, e.g. instead of being able to just write x^2, you said shit like "take the aformentioned quantity and multiply it with itself twice." 
> Late-sixteenth-century scientists who were engaged in calculating the facts of the universe had a sense that the important ideas, the truths behind the calculations, were struggling against the language in which they were trapped.
> The development of mathematical notation in this context was nothing short of revolutionary. The notational innovations of the seventeenth century— symbols and variables instead of words, equations instead of sentences—not only made it easier to keep track of which thing was which in a particular calculation; they also made it easier to see fundamental similarities and differences, and to draw generalizations that hadn't been noticed before. 
> In addition, the notation was universal; it could be understood no matter what your national language was. The pace of innovation in science accelerated rapidly. Modern physics and calculus were born. It seemed that the truth was finally being revealed through this new type of language. A tantalizing idea took hold: just imagine what might be revealed if we could express all of our thoughts this way.
