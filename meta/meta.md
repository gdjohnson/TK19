When writing up notes on a book, summarize and expand on passages with your own words. If you can't (you're not feeling it on a given day), delete the notes and start again another day. The inputting of notes is not a routine, secretarial job, but a process that cements knowledge in your brain.

Texts that are cited in multiple places should be broken out to their own text-scoped page. They should include the publication year and a link to the author.
