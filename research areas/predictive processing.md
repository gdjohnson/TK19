# Mutual prediction & sociality

_See [[Legibility]] and [[Intelligence as Futures Optimization]], specifically on mutual future modeling and self-legibilization in mixed-motive games._

Individuals “actively constrain their own behaviours so as to make themselves more easily predictable by other agents.” (Andy Clark, _Surfing Uncertainty_). This is typically referred to as “prosocial” behavior; unpredictable action is usually perceived as hostile or aggressive, which is part of the Asperberger’s stigma (a failure not just to model another mind but to incorporate its model of you into behavior).

# Temporal continuity & projection

To Henri Bergson, our experience of time, transformed into memory, is co-terminous with our perception.

**Perry 2018: Feeling the Future**

> Desynchronization in schizophrenia follows from not being able to piece together snapshots in time as a lived timeline, with implicit feeling of the past and future. Having shown up just now, unable in some cases to sense what was going on five minutes ago, or at the beginning of the sentence now being spoken, the schizophrenic struggles to find purchase on the present, and lacks a foundation for future cognition. In Fuchs’ model, his protention is impaired – the scope and content of his protentive field, unconsciously predicting each moment in normal persons, is limited to a few words or moments. Normal people carry with them an unconscious sense of the immediate past (a few seconds, at least) and this is seamlessly integrated with the biographical past. This provides a foundation for protention, the sense of the future: a projected field predicting likely futures and possible obstacles or rewards that might arise

# "Every agent becomes a model of its environment"

_See also Conant & Ashby's "good regulator theorem," foundational to cybernetics, which states:  "every good regulator of a system must be a model of that system."_

From "The Markov blankets of life"; see [[Markov blankets]] entry:

> any system that minimizes entropy by acting to minimize uncertainty about the hidden causes of its sensations must have a model of the kind of regularities it expects to encounter in its environment. This means that, over (phylogenetic and ontogenetic) time, an organism will become a model of its environment (note that natural selection is a form of Bayesian model selection, which will minimize free energy over an evolutionary time scale)... 

> any agent is a statistical model of its niche in the sense of coming to embody statistical regularities of its world in its physical and functional composition.

> A simple example that illustrates this point is that it is possible to consider the physiological make-up of a fish, say, as a model of the fluid dynamics and other elements that constitute its aquatic environment—its internal dynamics depend on the dynamics of the niche... In other words, an organism does not merely have a model of its world; rather it is a model.

## The role of a schema in perceptual sensemaking

### James 1890: Principles of Psychology

![[William James#^039835]]

### Kuhn 1976: Scientific Revolutions as Changes of World View 

> What a man sees depends both upon what he looks at and also upon what his previous visual-conceptual experience has taught him to see. In the absence of such training there can only be, in [[William James]]’s phrase, **“a bloomin’ buzzin’ confusion.”**

### [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], Truth & Lies in a Nonmoral Sense

> __Everything which distinguishes man from the animals depends upon this ability to volatilize perceptual metaphors in a schema, and thus to dissolve an image into a concept.__ For something is possible in the realm of these schemata which could never be achieved with the vivid first impressions: the construction of a pyramidal order according to castes and degrees, the creation of a new world of laws, privileges, subordinations, and clearly marked boundaries-a new world, one which now confronts that other vivid world of first impressions as more solid, more universal, better known, and more human than the immediately perceived world, and thus as the regulative and imperative world.

## Prediction

### James 1890

If there were no regularity in the world, no "universal laws" or "generic sequences," no abstract characters, then "from the experience of the past no future could be predicted; and reasoning, as we shall presently see, would be an impossibility."

### [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]

> the nervous system is an apparatus which has the function of getting rid of the stimuli that reach it, or of reducing them to the lowest possible level; or which, if it were feasible, would maintain itself in an altogether unstimulated condition
> 
> let us assign to the nervous system the task—speaking in general terms—of _mastering stimuli_

# Clark: Surfing Uncertainty

"incoming sensory signals... are met by a stream of downwards... predictions concerning the most probably state of their little world... The buzzing pro-active nature... of our ongoing neuronal processing...

> How, simply on the basis of patterns of stimulation across the sensory receptors, can embodied, situated brains alter and adapt so as to act as useful nodes (ones that incur considerable metabolic expense) for the origination of adaptive response? Notice how different this conception is to ones in which the problem is posed as one of establishing a mapping relation between environmental and inner states. The task is not to find such a mapping but to infer the nature of the signal source (the world) from just the varying input signal itself.

PP is deeply [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] in the sense of "our ontology is predicated on our purposes." Clark:

> as Eliasmith (2005, p. 102) points out, that ‘the set of possible stimuli is unknown, and an animal must infer what is being presented given various sensory cues’. I would add (to anticpate some of our later discussions) that ‘inferring what is being presented’ is deeply related to selecting apt actions.
