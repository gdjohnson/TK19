"In one way or another, we are all like the student who cheats on exams in order to make Phi Beta Kappa: it is often more important to have the symbol than what it stands for." (S. I. Hayakawa, _Language in Thought & Action_)

Some of the major contributors to [[surrogation]] are: transparency, decontextualization, and low-dimensionality of metrics; and short-termism, scientism, and distance in evaluation.

## Gioia 2002, "Being Good Versus Looking Good: Business School Rankings and the Circean Transformation From Substance to Image":

> news media rankings of business schools now seem to have taken on a life of their own, and their demigod-like character forces all schools to make changes that conform closely to their measurement criteria.
> The essential argument is that because the rankings emphasize criteria that are not necessarily germane to a quality education, they force business schools to devote resources to enhancing their standing on those criteria at the expense of genuine educational criteria. Furthermore, it becomes imperative that business schools project an image to external stakeholders of doing those things associated with achieving or maintaining the all-important ranking number, so that schools themselves begin to tout image-related features over bona fide quality features, much as businesses sometimes do. When business schools work only toward those goals that are measured, at the expense of valued but unmeasured goals, the process becomes a prime example of "perverse learning."
> Business schools are often confronted with a forced choice between being good and looking good, such that competition among business schools risks being transformed into a kind of beauty contest with some ugly consequences for the contestants because they are spending scarce resources on image-related features, rather than substantive program enhancements. (*cf* [[opticratics]])

Public rankings, gamification, and auditing all spur competition among players; there is a clear motivational benefit, and an incentive structure which rewards innovation. They also add a level of transparency and ease of evaluation to those choosing "horses" (that is, selecting a company, college, employer, etc). "There is, however, a way of viewing these rewards as the irresistible seductions of an enchantress who has other motives, a way of inducing all to satisfy her wishes, which, in the process, casts a spell that sets them up for their own unwitting and unavoidable participation in their own transformation."

Contributing to the great gap between what looks good or is good is how vague and unspecified, and how varying between students, the idea of a "quality education" is. Global rankings compresses a wide range of individual preferences—different environments under which a variety of students will thrive—into a single hierarchy, thereby evaporating any indexicality to the concept of "quality." Furthermore, many of the actually implemented rankings criteria are circular or tautological—job placement, staff prestige, the assessments of rival deans, and admission rate all measure, to a large extent, the existing prestige and reputation of the school, rather than anything "innate" or "inherent" to its quality as an educational institution. Images are manufactured from images, reputations from reputations; they are not even directly tethered, anymore, to the real thing. ([[Simulacra]]—the "relentless postmodernist progression of identity-becoming-image-becoming-illusion" [Gioia].) _And these indirect images are not even "neutral" or "passive" representations but, inevitably, reflexively act on the realities they depict_:

> If a school drops precipitously in the rankings, the proximal effects are that quality students no longer apply for admission, prestigious companies no longer recruit from the school, and external funding becomes harder to obtain, thus leading to the distal effects that the school admits lower-quality students, soon experiences less successful placements, and attracts fewer resources for creating new programs, all of which drops the school's ranking yet further. On the other hand, well-reputed (highly ranked) schools tend to garner higher starting salaries for their graduating MBAs and have their pick of next year's crop of prospective students. Those higher starting salaries, elevated GPA, and work experience numbers constitute key criteria for deciding next year's ranking, so the higher salaries and better in-coming students facilitate higher rankings, which facilitate higher salaries and better students, etc. The snow-ball effect of the rankings promotes a "rich-get richer and poor-get-poorer' cycle and creates a 'Catch 22' trap from which it is difficult to extricate oneself, win or lose."

The Circe-like transformation is one from "substantive academic content to illusory marketing practice."

Meanwhile, the short lifespan of academic deans creates [[short-termism]]; "there is little incentive for [deans] to invest resources in anything other than playing the rankings game on a 2-year cycle under the guise of 'staying current'.""

> It comes as no surprise that there is some evidence of schools gaming the system (and treading close to the edge ethically in doing so), with a whole litany of actions designed to circumvent or take advantage of the rankings methodologies or criteria—e.g., putting some incoming students (especially international or minority students) into a special "preadmission class" so their numbers do not count toward the final numbers tabulated and reported for the autumn MBA "entering class," admitting lower quality candidates into a masters of science program first and then transferring them to the MBA class after their first year, only reporting the average bonus for those receiving bonuses instead of reporting the average bonus for the whole class, as well as encouraging students to rank their own school highly or "risk lowering the value of their own degree" (Argenti, 2000).

One key aspect is the dimensionality of performance indicators: the lower-dimensional, i.e. the less indicators, the easier it is to game; the higher-dimensional, i.e. the more indicators weighed holistically together, the more difficult it is to game (Meyer & Gupta 1994). This is because few performances that are not "the real thing" can manage to satisfy the wide variety of metrics and criteria which the real thing would theoretically satisfy, whereas there are many possible performances which can match (or exceed) the performance of "the real thing" along a single axis. Gioia:

> Another less-obvious countering response to the rankings is for business schools, paradoxically, to encourage yet more rankings. More rankings, with increasingly diverse criteria, might just force business schools to conclude that they simply cannot develop responses to all the criteria of all the rankings. One possible response, then, is to ignore them all and get on with the substantive business at hand, as tiny St. John's College has done with some fanfare.

# Manheim 2016: Overpowered metrics eat underspecified goals

"Building systems using bad metrics doesn't stop their self-optimization, they just optimize towards something you didn't want... If [organizations'] metrics don't support their goals, goals will get lost in the organizational shuffle." (Value capture.) Attributes easy to measure are given outsized decisional weight, and attract more optimization energy. 

Any simplifications, distortions, or presumptions in the regulating model can be exploited by regulated agents: "employees understand the compensation system and seek to maximize their bonuses and promotion, drug manufacturers know the FDA requirements and seek to minimize cost to get their drug approved, and companies know the EPA regulations and seek to minimize the probability and cost of fines."
