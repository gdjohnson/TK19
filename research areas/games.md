## Background

"Games" were one of the popular conceptual metaphors of [[the sixties]]—[[Erving Goffman|Goffman]]'s [[_Strategic Interaction_ 1]], [[Thomas Schelling|Schelling]]'s [[_Strategy of Conflict_]], but also [[Eric Berne]]'s [[_Games People Play_]], [[Leonard Cohen]]'s _Favorite Game_, [[Jean Francois Lyotard|Lyotard]]'s _Just Gaming_, and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]]'s 1955 language games concept as published in [[_Philosophical Investigations_]]. In popular music, there was Dave Berry's "The Crying Game," Joni's "Circle Game," Lennon's "Mind Games," Jackson Frank's "The Blues Still Run The Game," Dylan's "Only A Pawn In Their Game." [[R.D. Laing]] theorized mental illness as a game played by individuals, in response to the pathological games hosted by institutions, or the nuclear family. In [[_Knots_]], he writes, "They are playing a game. They are playing at not playing a game. If I show them I see they are, I shall break the rules and they will punish me. I must play their game, of not seeing I see the game."

Zen teachings brought over to the West were framed in terms of giving up "ego games." Alan Watts cast the social game [[authenticity#^bd1691|as a double-bind]], in which "The first rule of this game is that it is not a game." [[Robert S. de Ropp]] made lists of life games, such as the "Art Game," "Science Game," "Religion Game," "Moloch Game," and "Master Game." Trip manuals were written describing the games played on psychedelics:

> The four games that follow: Baby, Couch, Drunk, and Let’s Have an Orgy overlap to some extent and have at their common root an attempt to evade responsibility in the session. Probably we all play various games to avoid responsibility in our daily lives, some of which LSD tends to cut through and expose to us. Some people, in an effort to avoid the discomfort of being exposed to themselves, plunge into a number of distracting games which seem to be attempts to prove that they are really drugged, irresponsible and don’t know what they are doing; or they may try to become completely dependent on someone else, like a child. Alcohol parties are the prototype for this kind of game in our culture. Be cause alcohol, in large doses, really does cloud consciousness and impair functionality, there is some truth in the claim that a drunken person is not fully responsible. This gives the game players tremendous latitude to make fools of themselves, excusing it later on the grounds that they were drunk.

[[Ken Kesey]] berated the Free Speech Movement Rally participants in '65 for "playing their [the government/establishment's] game," an ego and consumer game. [[Timothy Leary]] uses a game metaphor throughout _The Tibetan Book of the Dead_, casting personality as the product of game-playing. Central to these proclamations were a desire—and belief in the possibility of—escaping not just mainstream games, but the playing of games period, through counter-culture. Tom Wolfe writes in _The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test_:

> There is a lot about games. The straight world outside it seems, is made up of millions of people involved, trapped, in games they aren't even aware of.

From Joe South's 1968 "Games People Play":

> Whoa, the games people play now
> Every night and every day now
> Never meanin' what they say now
> Never sayin' what they mean
> While they wile away the hours
> In their ivory towers
> 'Til they're covered up with flowers
> In the back of a black limousine

For unclear reasons, the games metaphor—much like the once-nascent field of [[strategic interaction]]—petered out.

## Definition

I have defined a game as follows:

> A game is simply any interaction between agent and environment, where the agent’s goals or preferences transform the environment into sets of obstacles and affordances. The environment is composed of other agents and of non-agentic forces.

Game theorists take a slightly different approach, focusing their definition on strategy games between players, but still emphasizing preferences or goals, as well as an environment of play:
