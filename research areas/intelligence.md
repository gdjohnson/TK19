Directions include: time-scales of problem-solving, intelligence as general vs domain-specific problem-solving, intelligence as domain-specific or fitted to certain tasks & contexts (e.g. a cat is more intelligent than humans at catching mice).

Sarah Perry, "Cartographic Compression":
> The most primordial kind of intelligence is awareness of relevant features in the environment, coupled with responses to relevant information. This environmental awareness-response type of intelligence only makes sense in the light of goals (“relevant” to what?) – from a single-celled organism responding to the presence of food by consuming it, to a human noticing that a plant is dry and watering it.
> Evolution itself has acquired a great deal of intelligence; DNA is the transmissible record of the information evolution has acquired about the environment, from the perspective of billions of organisms with future existence as a “goal.”
