Meaning is purposive and contextual. Things are meaningful insofar as they are relevant to the goals of an organism, where goals are a desired delta in circumstance. The objective affordances and constraints of the environment in accomplishing these deltas constitute the "meaning" of a situation.

### The turn toward reader-response





# Meaning as significance

Meaning as significance, as in cosmic significance, is somehow and interestingly opposed to contingency. Taekwan Kim, in "What Is 'Degenerate'?" (2014) exposes this dynamic with reference to players' ability to tinker with default game settings, and their avoidance of customization:

> You avoid even looking at the options because that's how you keep from breaking into the realization that you are playing it somehow "less real" than you could [i.e., not the default or standard way]. You keep it default because that's how you keep the gaminess of it all—the fluidity of its rules—from shattering your rule immersion.

# Reader response

Wolfgang Iser, _Prospecting_:

> In _Ulysses_ this deconstruction marks the switch from representation to effect. If __the novel is first and foremost a structure for eliciting responses and thereby engaging its readers__, then a theory that is applicable to such literature must incorporate this change: it must replace the author-oriented perspective by one that is reader-oriented.

What a text "is" is a set of signs, placed for a variety of conscious and unconscious purposes by an author, to serve as a stimulus for human minds. A sample of potential stimulations includes interestingness, empathy, moral dilemma, political provocation, etc. The print-run of a book is the manufacturing of a thousand eggs, distributed for fertilization by a thousand readers, and each one lifeless until the moment it comes into contact with a reader. The "work" exists in the varied exchanges, much like a musical score is "actualized" first by its performer and then by its listener. We can attempt to get closer to the composer's [[intent]], or to advance an alternate "reading" of the piece that brings out different attributes or makes it accessible to modern audiences. But there is no "true" state of the piece, there is only a multiplicity. The text is a "substrate," and each reader a reagent; it takes on a different color depending on which reagent it interacts with. And who is to say what the "true" color of the substrate is? It has no color on its own; the color is emergent from interaction. And who is to say which interaction is more "true"? It depends how we define it. There is no doubt a model of an intended audience member, or a ballpark area of an intended audience member, such that we can safely speculate a 19th century writer did not mean "gay" in the way a contemporary reader would interpret it. But should the text take on new powers in a new frame, should it light up an electric blue on contact with a new way of seeing, who are we to say that this interaction is "false"? More accurately we would say, our understanding of the textual substrate in its entirety—its many aspects, which varyingly reveal themselvse to the right observing party—has been enriched. We have "seen" the thing in _objective_—which is to say "full set of subjective possibilities"—states that even its own author could not—did not—understand. And nowhere in this description do we see a need to settle on a text's "meaning"; we have evaded the question, because the question is a non-question; it is incoherent; taken at-face, it fundamentally misunderstands language, the way many "overlapping... fibres" make up a thread ([[Wittgenstein]]).

And though we are complex reagents, there is a deterministic, objective fact about how the text will "hit us," once we have accounted for the environmental context, the frame we enter it with, etc. (That this accounting is practically impossible has no bearing on its theoretical fact.) Texts themselves are complex; it is a highly unpredictable substrate, which its designer may understand formally in isolation—may know perfectly well the structural arrangements and quantities of particles—and yet be able to say very little about how it will interact with a complex, untested environment. This is the situation of the writer—the situation of the chemist.

Interestingly, there is a similar discourse or ideological conflict when it comes to the question of _self_. One view of the self, which traces through romanticism and 20th century expressivity cults, sees the self as essential and socially suppressed. Perhaps the "true" self can only emerge in seclusion, on a retreat to the wilderness, for instance. Or it can only come out in the presence of a trusting intimate partner. The other view of self is that the self is a construction of a relationship _between_ human beings. That we have many selves which are activated in different contexts. We might choose one or the other to define as "true" for practical or functional reasons, but the multiplicity of _interactive relationships_ is stressed over the monism of _essential identity_. This is the thesis of a book like Philippe Rochat's _Others In Mind_ (2011) e.g.

# Pragmatic meaning

From [[William James]] 1907:

> The pragmatic method is primarily a method of settling metaphysical disputes that otherwise might be interminable. Is the world one or many?—fated or free?—material or spiritual? [...] The pragmatic method in such cases is to try to interpret each notion by tracing its respective practical consequences.

> Mr. [[C.S. Peirce|Peirce]], after pointing out that our beliefs are really rules for action, said that, to develop a thought's meaning, we need only determine what conduct is is fitted to produce: that conduct is for us its sole significance.

> "All realities influence our practice," [[[C.S. Peirce|Peirce]]] wrote me, "and that influence is their meaning for us... In what respects would the world be different if this alternative or that were true? If I can find nothing that would be different, then the alternative has no sense.

# Fields and Levin 2020: How do systems create meaning?

To Fields and Levin, all living systems are capable of cognitive "meaning." Here, meaning emerges in cognition through systems' cross-referencing of their "perceptions, actions, and memories," such that perceptions (of the environment) are meaningful in light of the future (their affect on actions) and the past (the system's memories). See also discussion by Levin & Dennett of the "cognitive horizon" in the [[Superorganisms]] entry.

> Bateson famously defined a “unit” of information as a “difference which makes a difference” ([56] p. 460). As Roederer points out, information so defined is actionable or pragmatic; it “makes a difference” for what an organism can do [57]. It is, therefore, information that is meaningful to the organism in a context that requires or affords an action, consistent with sensory-motor meaning being the most fundamental component of language as broadly construed [6]. It is in this fundamental sense that meaning is “enactive” [19].

Such meanings require _reference frames_, in the physics sense: a "kind of difference to be recognized, e.g... in size, shape, color, or motion" alongside "a specific reference value, e.g. this big or that shape."
