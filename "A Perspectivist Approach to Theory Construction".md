Author: [[Bill McGuire]]

Most psychological theories, McGuire writes, take the form of IV --> MV --> DV. That is, an independent variable alters a dependent variable by way of a mediating variable. And this relationship can be positive or negative in direction, e.g. IV --> +MV --> +DV or IV --> -MV --> -DV.

[[Perspectivism]] is all about methodically mapping "other implicit directions of relations between the two variables" under investigation, IV and DV, and perhaps MV as well.

> The most sophisticated and popular psychology of science prior to perspectivism, the Wienerkreis logical empiricism movement, prescribed that the research should be deductive in using [[conceptual analysis]] to derive a hypothesis (and a theory from which this hypothesis could be derived) before setting out inductively on the labor-intensive empirical investigation. [[Perspectivism]] is even more demanding regarding the scope of the a priori conceptualization. It prescribes that before collecting data on the relations the researcher should consider explicitly not only the initial hypothesis but also its contrary, and not only one explanation but several explanations of each hypothesis, both the initial hypothesis and its contrary.

McGuire quotes [[William Blake]] in his quasi-[[generalized compatibilism|compatibilist]] argument: "Everything possible to be believed is an image of truth." 

Here McGuire maps out four theses. Quadrant A represents the thesis that exposure to violent TV --> +Aggression. Quadrant B represents the thesis that violent TV --> -Aggression. Quadrant C, that Aggression --> +TV. Quadrant D, that Aggression --> -TV. In each quadrant, McGuire has identified established research ideas that would support the relevant thesis. ^46b689
