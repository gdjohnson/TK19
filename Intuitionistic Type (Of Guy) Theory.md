> Constructing a new Type of guy happens in two phases. The first phase constructs the Type by pointing to a recognizable behavior or set of behaviors, reifying what had previously been unpatterned information into an Essence ("Type of guy who reads David Foster Wallace on the L train"). The second phase passes Judgment on the newly constructed Type, asserting a proper valence, a position in some local status hierarchy, or an appropriate level of disdain/condescension/pity to direct. In this way, a Type is a label that embodies a [[decision rules|decision rule]]. If [recognizable traits] then [treat this way]. Here's how to spot it, here's how to react. It seems like the most common way to react is some variation of dismissal. You recognize the Type, you roll your eyes, and you stop listening.
