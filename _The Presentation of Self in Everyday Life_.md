# Goffman: The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life

Goffman's performance is "all the activity of an individual which occurs during a period marked by [an individual's] continuous presence before a particular set of observers and which has some influence on the observers." A "front," meanwhile, is "the expressive equipment of a standard kind intentionally or unwittingly employed by the individual during his performance." Sometimes, performers rely on a "set" which they either opportunistically seize, travel to for performances, or carry with them as in the case of "the funeral cortege, the civic parade, and the dream-like processions that kings and queens are made of."

## Belief in the Part One is Playing

> When an individual plays a part he implicitly requests his observers to take seriously the impression that is fostered before them. They are asked to believe that the character they see actually possesses the attributes he appears to possess, that the task he performs will have the consequences that are implicitly claimed for it, and that, in general, matters are what they appear to be. 

Goffman takes the Trivers [[deception#Self-deception|self-deception]] stance:
> At one extreme, we find that the performer can be fully taken in by his own act; he can be sincerely convinced that the impression of reality which he stages is the real reality... At the other extreme, we find that the performer may not be taken in at all... This possibility is understandable, since no one is in quite as good an observational position to see through the act as the person who puts it on. 

> When the individual has no belief in his own act and no ultimate concern with the beliefs of his audience, we may call him cynical, reserving the term sincere for individuals who believe in the impression fostered by their own performance.

> It is not assumed... that all cynical performers are interested in deluding their audiences for purposes of what is called "self-interest" or private gain. A cynical individual may delude his audience for what he considers to be illustrations of their own good, or for the good of the community, etc. For illustrations of this we need not appeal to sadly enlightened showmen such as Marcus Aurelius or Hsun Tzu. We know that in service occupations practitioners who may otherwise be sincere are sometimes forced to delude their customers because their customers show such a heartfelt demand for it. Doctors who are led into giving placebos, filling-station attendants who resignedly check and recheck tire pressures for anxious women motorists, shoe clerks who sell a shoe that fits but tell the customer it is the size she wants to hear—these are cynical performers whose audiences will not allo wthem to be sincere.

The roles we play eventually come to feel natural, and thus can be sincerely performed:
> For the last four or five years the island's tourist hotel has been owned by a married couple of crofter origins. From the beginning, the owners were forced to set aside their own conceptions as to how life ought to be led, displaying in the hotel a full round of middle-class services and amenities. Lately, however, it appears that the managers have become less cynical about the performance that they stage; they themselves are becoming middle class and more and more enamoured of the selves their clients impute to them.

Shamanism is perhaps our best anthro-historical example of opticratics at work. Goffman quotes Kroeber, _The Nature of Culture_:
> Next, there is the old question of deception. Probably most shamans or medicine men, the world over, help along with sleight-of-hand in curing and especially in exhibitions of power. This sleight-of-hand is sometimes deliberate; in many cases awareness is perhaps not deeper than the foreconscious. The attitude, whether there has been represession or not, seems to be as toward a pious fraud. Field ethnographers seem quite generally convinced that even shamans who know that they add fraud also believe in their powers, and especially in thoes of other shamans: they consult them when they themselves or their children are ill.

Quoting Macgowan, _Sidelights on Chinese Life_: "He is an ideal-looking official, for he is alrge and massive in appearance, whilst he has that stern and uncomprising look that is supposed to be necessary in any magistrate who would hope to keep his subjects in order. He has a stern and forbidding aspect, as though he were on his way to the execution ground to have some criminal decapitated."

Metaphor plays a strong role insofar as different fronts reference one another in order to signify. "Observers then only need be familiar with a small and hence manageable vocabulary of fronts and know how to respond to them in order to orient themselves in a wide variety of situations"—see also [[typification]]. But this excerpt implies a strange teleology—fronts do not take the "ease" of memory of observers into account, rather, they take into account the _lack_ of observer knowledge as to some new signification field, and instead reference an existing conventional signification, in order to be understood. Thus,
> if the individual takes on a task that is not only new to him but also unestablished in the society, or if he attempts to change the light in which the task is viewed, he is likely to find that there are already several well-established fronts among which he must choose.

In other words, "fronts tend to be selected, not created."

> a given social front tends to become institutionalized in terms of the abstract stereotyped expectations to which it gives rise, and tends to take on a meaning and stability apart from the specific tasks which happen at the time to be performed in its name. The front becomes a "collective representation" and a fact in its own right. [cf [[typification]]]

## Dramatic Realization

> While in the presence of others, the individual typically infuses his activity with signs which dramatically highlight and portray confirmatory facts that might otherwise remain unapparent or obscure.
