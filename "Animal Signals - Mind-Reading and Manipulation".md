> Many of the externally visible features of animals, many of their behaviour patterns, many chemical substances and most of the sounds given off by them, are best interpreted as being adapted—designed by natural selection—to influence the behaviour of other animals, and are often referred to as signals.
> [Signals] may attract the other animal, as when a male cricket calls females to his burrow; they may repel the other animal as in a male robin's territorial song; they may exert some long-term influence on the other animal's physiology, as when the song of a male canary causes his mate's ovaries to open over a period of days.
> [Signals] may, of course, have effects other than those for which natural selection designed them. for example, the song of the cricket _Gryllus integer_ is designed to call females, but it also has the (eventually fatal) effect of calling parasitic flies.
> Signals, by definition, transfer information in the technical sense, reducing the observer's uncertainty about the actor's or reactor's future behaviour.

## Manipulation

The authors define signaling as an attempt to [[all communication is manipulation|manipulate other organisms]], of "exploiting other animals as tools":
> The counterpart to "manipulation" by the actor is "mind-reading" by the reactor. The evolution of many animal signals is best seen as an interplay between mind-reading and manipulation.
> our own definition of a signal [is] a means by which one animal makes use of another animal's muscle power
> [An organism] will tend to use objects in its environment to its own best advantages. These objects will include inanimate ones such as the stone used by a song thrush or by a sea otter to smash mollusc shells. But many of the most important objects in an animal's world will themselves be living bodies with their own nerves and muscles, programmed to work for their own genetic advantage. The possibility of exploitation is there for another living being as it is for a stone.

However, crucially, the living being or agent can be manipulated with _information_ in a way the stone can only be manipulated with physical force. Intriguingly, in Krebs & Dawkins' factoring, by taking the receiver's interpretive schema for granted (in a sort of intention-less, billiards ball model of stimulus response) the "voluntariness" of information-based manipulation is abstracted away:
> An angler fish propels its prey towards its mouth not by its own direct muscular force but by waving a tempting lure. Finally it is the prey fish's own muscles that do the work of propulsion. The angler fish causes this to happen in much the same way as an electrophysiologist might be means of stimulating electrodes. The angler fish has no electrodes but exerts a similar effect on the prey fish's muscles via the prey fish's own sense organs. 
> however complex [the female otter] may be, her behaviour is governed by laws which are ascertainable. This being so, it is in principle possible to exploit these laws in such a way as to manipulate her behaviour. A male sea otter does not have to be consciously aware of these laws, nor does he have to design his techniques to manipulate the female. Natural selection itself will favour male sea otters whose behaviour happens to take advantage of the lawfulness of female behaviour. The effect is that the male manipulates the female in much the same way as he manipulates a stone.

I believe it is crucial, however, to add that the female otter is selected in favour of not being manipulated, at least to the extent that she wishes to remain choosy and discriminating in her choice of mates, and to not sacrifice her own fitness for the sake of another otter's, and thereby must develop protections. The only reliable manipulations of her which survive evolutionarily will be those which also benefit her. 

Between force and information (using Bateson's frame), there is the "direct interference with brain tissue," or the hijacking of chemical and signaling pathways in the brain.
> _Dicrocoelium dendriticum_, a trematode parasite of sheep and ants, makes a lesion in the ant's brain. This changes the ant's behaviour in such a way that it, and therefore the worm, is more likely to be eaten by the worm's definitive host, a sheep.

## Ritualization

The authors argue that signaling behaviors evolve from behaviors which originally did not have a signaling function; after Tinbergen 1952, they call this "derived activities"; the process of behaviors evolving signaling functinos they call "ritualization." 
> the scent glands that play so large a part in the social life of mammals are clearly ritualized sweat glands and sebaceous glands. Their structure exhibits obvious homology with unritualized glands in the same individual.

The authors write that while pre-ritualized behaviors or phenotypic features may have had "effects on other individuals, these are incidental." And yet, I believe that these effects on other individuals are key insofar as they are what drive the ritualization (in the direction of advantageous effects on other organisms).

## Mind-reading
> For an animal that has any kind of social life, or that is a predator is is preyed upon, [the] probably consequences [of its actions] will depend crucially on the internal motivational state and probable future behaviour of other animals—rivals, mates, parents, offspring, prey, predators, parasites, hosts.
> Animals can in principle forecast the behaviour of other animals, because sequences of animal behaviour follow statistical rules... we may use the word "mind-reading" as a catch-word to describe what we are doing when we use statistical laws to predict what an animal will do next... A dog with its teeth bared is statistically more likely to bite than a dog with its teeth covered.

## Coevolution

> Our argument so far may be summarized as follows: the conspicuous ritualized signals familiar to ethologists are the product of a co-evolutionary race between what we have termed the manipulator and the mind-reader roles.

They posit two types of coevolution, one (the more common) being characterized by conflict and arms race; the other more cooperative:
> if the reactor _benefits_ from receiving the signal and responding in accord with the actor's interests, instead of heightened sales-resistance leading to exaggeration of the signal during evolution we would expect to see heightened sensitivity to the signal leading to a _reduction_ in the amplitude and conspicuousness of the signal. This is because every signal has a cost: it may attract predators, use up time and energy, or reduce the actor's efficiency at doing other things.
> In short, the evolution of cooperative signalling should lead not to loud, exaggerated, repetitive, conspicuous signals, but to cost-minimizing conspiratorial whispers.
> [In the natural kingdom], many of the conspiratorial whispers of cooperative signaling may even have not yet been detected.

(I find this explanation somewhat "iffy" insofar as it glosses and simplifies, insofar as it does not acknowledge or discuss that it is costly to be more receptive to the signal—e.g. more attention, better sensory organs, being over-sensitive and thus prone to Type II errors.)
