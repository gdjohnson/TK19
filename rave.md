# Hannah Baer, Rave & Revolution

> Even before _The Matrix Reloaded_ (2003), everyone knew that raving would persist postapocalypse. In the present day, there are two ways raving can be dystopian. One is goth: everyone dancing in a place no one particularly wants to be (an abandoned industrial building, the middle of a cornfield, under a bridge), at a time when no one wants to be awake, to sounds basically no one except the people under the bridge wants to hear at volumes that most people don’t want to hear. Add to that, during a different part of the pandemic, that no one was supposed to be hanging out. Anyone who knows can come, but not everyone wants to. 

> The second way it can be dystopian—the normie way—is people waiting in long lines to get into crowded nightclubs where the price of admission is often more than the price of a cheap meal for several people, spending wages they made using their bodies, bodies that they will then effectively disable with drugs to help them make meaning out of meaninglessness—and avoid sleep—and also to just move around all night toward a supposed catharsis.
