McKinsey 1952, _Theory of Games_: the strategy game framework throws "light on all kinds of situation in which various people have opposing goals and in which each of them, although he may exert some influence on the outcome, cannot completely dominate the course of events."

# Bernard 1954: The Theory of Games of Strategy as a Modern Sociology of Conflict

> For many years economists began their analyses with a single individual and on the basis of this so-called "Robinson Crusoe model" erected a systemo f theory in which individuals tended to maximize their gains in a world in which they had control over most of the factors involved. Such a model, however, did not fit the facts of life very closely. Actually people are rigorously and even rigidly limited in their behavior. They have to plain their behavior with the knowledge that they may be checkmated at any point by opponents. They do not have a free situation in which they can maximize their benefits. They are in a system in which every choice of behavior on their part may be nullified by some choice of behavior on the part of someone else.
