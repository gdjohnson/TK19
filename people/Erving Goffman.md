![[Everyday Interaction]]

Goffman's students include: Arlie Hochschild, Eviatar Zerubavel, Harvey Sacks, John Lofland, David Snow, Gary Alan Fine, Carol Brooks Gardner, Marojorie Goodwin, Gary Marx, Emanuel Schegloff, David Sudnow, and Charles Goodwin (semiotician).

Goffman built on top the symbolic interactionist frame developed by [[George Herbert Meade]]. Matthew Rowe has linked his work to that of the American pragmatists and [[Pierre Bourdieu]], in his 2012 "Practice With A Purpose." From the abstract:
> Pragmatist understandings of truth, habit, and self ground the discussion of commonality and divergence among these theorists. Goffman expands the analysis to the meso-level of situation and institution, adding conflict and the struggle for individual affirmation. Bourdieu elevates the analysis again, showing how individual and group habitus relate to interlocking fields of social practice. The social nature of habitus and the non-conscious generation of dispositions make possible new understandings of the perpetuation of domination, but suffer somewhat from the lost pragmatist attention to individual experience and resourcefulness. 

Rowe continues:
> The affinities between the work of Pierre Bourdieu and that of Erving Goffman and the American pragmatist philosophers have been remarked upon by social theorists (e.g., Alexander 1995; Emirbayer and Goldberg 2005) and by Bourdieu himself (Bourdieu 1983; Bourdieu and Wacquant 1992: 122), yet these conceptual traces have not been studied in detail.

# From the Goffman Archive

Interview with Angelo Alonzo, former MA student, on having Goffman as his advisor:
> One of the most enchanting experiences I had with him was when I encountered him coming out of Barrows Hall. I had a couple of questions to ask him and asked if he had time, he said “No” but if I wanted to talk with him as he ran a couple of errands on Telegraph Ave I was welcome to come along. We dropped something off along the way and then went into the Post Office on Dwight Way. The place was its usual busy self with three windows open and four people deep. He quickly assessed the situation, picked a window, put his hand in the cage holding two fingers up and with his other hand slid change for two stamps. Without a pause the postmaster slid two stamps in his direction, he beamed, licked the stamps and posted his two envelopes. To this day when anyone in the family games a cue, we always say we pulled a “Goffman.”

Peter Zelchenko, whose mother Phyllis studied English with Goffman at Chicago:
> As she tells it, she, Goffman, and Birdwhistell went to some mixer at another student's house in Hyde Park. The living room had about 15 or 20 people but it was very quiet, with people nervously sipping their drinks, “and nobody really looking at each other or talking to each other.” At one point, Goffman got up and moved to the center of the room and began doing a mime strip-tease, starting with “taking off” his tie and proceeding gradually to other and more intimate items of clothing. My mother said she started laughing out loud, and at first nobody seemed to understand.

[[Thomas Schelling]] was a friend and advocate of Goffman, and called him one of the top two or three sociologists of the 20th C:
> I met him when he was at the Institutes of Health in Washington. He approached me, I visited him and we talked, and I think he gave me reprints of “Facework” and “Cooling the Mark Out,” which I’ve always loved. Sometime in the middle 60’s I invited him to Harvard’s Center for International Affairs, at which I had some Ford Foundation money for bringing scholars to Harvard, and he spent a year, finishing one of his books; I don’t remember which one. Some time later his son, Tom, came to live at my house for a while. He was a very assertive young man and taught my kids how to make explosives out of the chlorine powder that my neighbor used for his swimming pool.

Schelling was also acquainted with [[Harold Garfinkel]], to whom he introduced [[Harvey Sacks]] (future founder of conversational analysis). [[Pierre Bourdieu]] made statements as to his friendship and admiration of Goffman, in his Erving Goffman Prize lecture at Berkeley.
