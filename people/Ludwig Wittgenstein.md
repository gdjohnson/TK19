# Luigi Perissinotto 2003: Wittgenstein and Plato

_See also [[Conceptual Engineering]], [[conceptual analysis]], and [[Against Philosophy]] entries._

> Wittgenstein made no bones about his less than high regard for the Platonic [[Socrates]], to the point of confessing, around 1930, that "it has puzzled me why Socrates is regarded as a great philosopher" or remarking the following year (July 1931) that "reading the Socratic dialogue, one has the feeling: what a frightful waste of time! What's the point of these arguments that prove nothing and clarify nothing"

Wittgenstein, more even-handedly, on Plato: 

> Perhaps Plato is no good, perhaps he's very good. How should I know? But if he is good, he's doing something which is foreign to us. We do not understand. Perhaps if I could read Greek!

## On concepts and meaning

> For Wittgenstein, as for [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] before him, Platonism and the question it has imposed on us ("What is it?") has thus become a constant term of dialogue and debate. It is not fortuitous that Wittgenstein opens the _Blue Book_ with this very question and with the "mental cramps" it produces, thus indicating the liberation from Platonic bewilderment to be one of the tasks of his philosophizing: "The questions _What is length?_, _What is meaning?_, _What is the number one?_ etc produce in us a mental cramp. We feel that we can't point to anything in reply to them and yet ought to point to something. (We are up against one of the great sources of philosophical bewilderment: a substantive makes us look for a thing that corresponds to it)."

Quoting Wittgenstein:

> But that is the difficulty [[Socrates]] gets caught up in when he tries to give the definition of a concept. Again and again an application of the word emerges that seems tot to be compatible with the concept to which other applications have led us. We say: but that _isn't_ how it is!—it _is_ like that though!—& all we can do is keep repeating these antitheses.

Perissinotto:

> Wrestling oneself free from the force of this antithesis is one of the tasks, if not _the_ task, that Wittgenstein assigns to his philosophizing, which, from this point of view, takes the shape of a struggle against [[Socrates]] and Platonism.
