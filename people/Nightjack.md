## April 27 2008, "Goalposts Moving"

> PC Ellie Bloggs posted on her blog that manslaughter is the new murder. I have to take slight issue with that. Manslaughter is still the old murder, it is just that now it has a smart lawyer and a psychiatric report. I speak in terms of the gradual extension of the doctrine of diminished responsibility. This is a defence that can reduce murder to manslaughter. Was it a new law? Nope, just the usual judges having another look at where the boundaries should be placed...
> Thus any sensible defence lawyer will be looking for a psychiatric report containing such phrases as "Adjustment Disorder...," "Personality Disorder...," "Severe Personality Disorder...," "Depressed," "Morbid Jealousy," "Post Traumatic Stress Disorder," "Persecutory Delusional Disorder," "Alcohol Dependency Syndrome...," "Acute Stress Reaction," "Khat/Amphetamine Psychosis."
> ...Once a defence team hear that somebody has gone one of these [defences] home, strangely more defendants seem to start suffering from it. It's a bit like nationality/religion/persecution stories with asylum seekers, where the circumstances leading to a successful application become viral.
