## Bourdieu 1986: Principles for a Sociology of Cultural Works

_See also [[New Criticism]]._

Bourdieu contrasts two types of formalists readings: one, the "neo-Kantian tradition of symbolic forms," the other structuralism, founded on Saussure's idea of the "primacy of relations" to understanding language: 

> if one insists on giving a theoretical basis to this formalist tradition... one can move in two directions: on the one hand, the neo-Kantian tradition of symbolic forms or, more generally, all the traditions which seek to discover universal anthropological structures, such as Mircea Eliade's comparative mythology or Jungian or Bachelardian psychoanalysis, which academic hermeneutics easily borrow and eagerly combine; on the other hand, the structuralist tradition. 

> In the first case, through a tautegorical reading which relates works only to themselves, critics seek to rediscover the universal forms of poetic or literary reason, ahistorical structures which are at the basis of a poetic construction of the world. This position, perhaps because it is untenable, is hardly expressed as such, although it pervades all investigations of an "essence" of the poetic, of the symbol, of metaphor, and so on.

> The structuralist solution is intellectually and socially more powerful. Socially, it has taken over internalist doxa and bestowed a scientific aura to internal reading as a formal stripping, a dismantling of atemporal works. Breaking with neo-Kantian universalism, structuralist hermeneutics treats cultural works (language, myths, and by extension, works of art) as structured concepts without a structuring subject, which, like the Saussurean concept of _langue_, are particular historical realizations and must therefore be deciphered as such, but without any recourse to an external hermeneutics, that is, without reference to the social or economic conditions of the production of the work or the production of the producers of the work (such as the educational system).

Roman Jakobson was a bridge between Russian formalism and structuralism, and the two modes share a deal in common, emphasizing the "system of works," the "network of relationships among texts, or _intertextuality_, to be the outer enveloping layer of meaning for literary texts.

Thus someone like Foucault, 

> Aware that a work does not exist by itself, that is, outside relationships of interdependence which unite it to other works, [...] gives the name "field of strategic possibilities" to the "regulated system of differences and dispersions" within which each individual work defines itself.

# Genetic structuralism

Genetic structuralism, developed by Lucien Goldmann in the 1960s, was a bridge between structuralism, with its relational autonomy of language and texts, and  contextualizing externalist readings of the time. Structures like language and social hierarchy are not "natural" or always-already existing, but are in perpetual flux: they are adapted to changing environments, they are a sort of "infinite game" of sense-making, and they are "genetic" (or really, "memetic") in the sense that there is a historical continuity between structural forms. (See also [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]'s use of "genealogy" in describing historical processes or dialectics.)

# In sociology

## Structuralism vs. existentialism

Consider the false dichotomy presented by the dialectic between Existentialism, with its unwielding Sartrean commitment to personal freedom in the face of all obstacles, and Structuralism, with its "cultural dopes" or [[zombies|zombie]]-carriers of culture, who can merely enact the norms and rules of their society, as a false choice. It is more accurate to say the system is cybernetic, where bottom-up behavior affects top-down structure (as e.g. [[ethnomethodology]]'s "spontaneous organization" illuminates) but also a kind of "social reality" is internalized by actors which populates a narrow-ish space of default (or "automatic") possibile speech and action, which in many cases requires self-consciousness—in the Hegelian sense, as [[reflexivity]]—to break out of or overcome.

## Objectivism vs. subjectivism

To Bourdieu, it is simply and obviously the case that "objective" or "physical" social structures exist in a world of institutions, relational networks, and class dynamics of material disparity—and also the case that these realities exist, simultaneously, in the cognitive schemas of actors who live within them, often in ways which distort, embellish, or cover-up the objective realities. Each feeds into the other: to reference Henrich's theories of prestige and social copying, there is an objective fact about cultural evolution and behavioral mimetics, who is copying who. There is a subjective fact about resource allocation, asymmetrical attention, and decisional deference that amount to the objective structures of "prestige." But there is also a subjective fact about admiration, desire, and the impression of prestige. The two are inseparable; each contributes to and shapes the other. 

Bourdieu 1986, "Social Space and Symbolic Power," discussing and breaks down the false dichotomy between subjectivism and objectivism (see also [[Generalized Compatibilism]] entry):

> It is [what [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] calls the] sense of one's place which, in interactions, leads people whom we call in French "les gens modestes," "common folks," to keep to their common place, and the others to "keep their distance," to "maintain their rank," and to "not get familiar." These strategies, it should be noted in passing, may be perfectly unconscious and take the form of what is called timidity or arrogance. In effect, social distances are inscribed in bodies or, more precisely, into the relation to the body, to language and to time—so many structural aspects of practice ignored by the subjectivist vision.

> The opposition is total: in the first instance, scientific knowledge can be obtained only by means of a break with primary representations—called "pre-notions" in Durkheim and "ideologies" in Marx‚ leading to unconscious causes. In the second instance, scientific knowledge is in continuity with common sense knowledge, since it is nothing but a "construct of constructs." [...] [S]ocial science must take as its object both this reality and the perception of this reality, the perspectives, the points of view which, by virtue of their position in objective social space, agents have on this reality. The spontaneous visions of the social world, the "folk theories" ethnomethodologists talk about, or what I call "spontaneous sociology," but also scientific theories, sociology included, are part of social reality, and, like Marxist theory for instance, can acquire a truly real power of construction.
