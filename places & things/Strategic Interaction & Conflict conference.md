Year: [[1964]]

"Strategic interaction" originally Goffman's coinage, chosen by organizers to "designate a particular network of concepts of interest to several disciplines," and focus on "mixed-motive games."

### Participants
- [[Thomas Schelling]]
- [[Erving Goffman]]
- Kathleen Archibald: conference organizer; went on to serve as a staffer at RAND; is acknowledged in [[_Strategic Interaction_ 1]] for providing helpful comments on an early draft.
- Frederick Balderston: chairman of Goffman's discussion session; Quaker and conscientious objector (ambulance corps) in WWII
- [[Alex Bavelas]]: experimental psychologist, researched communication patterns & group stability
- [[Jessie Bernard]]: before becoming a prominent feminist sociologist, Bernard got her start as conflict- and game-theorist; influenced by the research on conflict of [[Robert E. Park]]; more enthusiastic than Goffman about using formal, mathematical models & matrices in sociological modeling
- Morton Deutsch: Columbia social psychologist, WWII air force veteran
- [[Daniel Ellsberg]]: ex-Marine platoon leader; ex-RAND strategist; served under Robert McNamara in State Department; intimately familiar with command and control structure of America's nuclear arsenal; responsible for leak of Vietnam War documents later known as Pentagon Papers
- [[William Gamson]]: political sociologist, author _The Strategy of Social Protest_
- John C. Harsanyi: Hungarian-American economist, game-theorist; would go on to share a Nobel Prize in economics with [[John Nash]] and Reinhardt Selten
- [[Anatol Rapoport]]: pacifist and socialist; RAND researcher; author of _Fights, Games and Debates_; game-theorist who attempted to move beyond von Neumann and Morgenstern, replacing their rationalistic, zero-sum emphasis with an ethical position
- Martin Shubik: Yale economist and game theorist; RAND consultant
- Albert Wohlstetter: RAND nuclear strategist; swept away many Eisenhower-era nuclear deterrence views—e.g. massive retaliation principle—in favor of limited war & second-strike principles; regularly challenged by Goffman at the conference

## Discussion topics
- "The Concept of Rationality" (introd. Harsanyi)
- "The Vocabulary of Basic Moves" (introd. Schelling)
- "Communication and Enforcement Systems" (introd. Goffman)
	- Goffman's talk centered around an attempt to create coherence between different fields pertaining to interaction & communication studies, identifying [[Robert E. Park]] and [[Ernest W. Burgess]] (_Introd. to the Science of Scoiety_, 1921) as the founders of these topics in sociology
	- Goffman identified four sociological subject domains centered on communication, all of which he had previously worked in:
		1. The study of face-to-face interaction and social gathering
		2. Intelligence systems and agencies (see "Expression Games" subject matter)
		3. Interpersonal activity, i.e. the structural factors governing individual motivations, relationships, facework, ritual
		4. Strategic interaction, which involves interdependence of player fate ("massive interdependence")
	- Goffman at this point was emphasizing adversarial situations over cooperative ones, and was challenged by Ellsberg for doing so. At one point, Balderston, exasperated, calls Goffman the sorcerer's apprentice, requests that "sorcerer" TS "straighten Goffman out," but EG was defended by TS
