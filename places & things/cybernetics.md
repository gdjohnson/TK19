Many of the concepts we associate with French theory are in fact laundered cybernetic, [[game theory|game-theoretic]], and [[information theory|information-theoretic]] ideas, twice-translated: the information-theoretic importance of difference (that makes a difference); the top-down [[social construction|construction of reality]]; Lacanian game theories (jeu); Deleuzean feedback. (For more, see Lydia H. Liu, "The Cybernetic Unconscious: Rethinking Lacan, Poe, and French Theory.")

> [[people/Norbert Wiener|Wiener]] wrote fiction, corresponded with [[T. S. Eliot]], and he even published his own literary criticism, including a substantial article on [[Rudyard Kipling]]. [[Clause Shannon|Shannon]] wrote critically about [[Edgar Allen Poe|Poe]]’s essay “Maelzel’s Chess-Player” but not much else, although he did bring up [[James Joyce’]]s [[_Finnegans Wake_]] during the experimental work he carried out on information theory. [[Alan Turing]] enacted a series of botched hide-and-seek games when he tried to imitate Captain Kidd of “The Gold Bug” to bury his silver bars and banknotes in the countryside during World War II.

# Cybernetics and anti-inductivity
_See full [[anti-inductive]] entry._

> [[people/Norbert Wiener|Wiener]] became interested in cybernetics while developing computers and automated anti-aircraft artillery during World War II. When tracking a flying aircraft you make a number of observations to predict its future position. But — said [[people/Norbert Wiener|Wiener]] — in war the actions of the gunner need to be part of such a prediction as well! After all, the pilot will change course in response to enemy fire. The gunner will adjust in turn, leading to a cycle of adjustments and re-adjustments.
    
This is anti-inductivity, right? The only difference is conceptual frame/perspective—anti-inductive assumes a multi-player game where the deployment of a strategy alters opponent behavior in a way that mitigates the advantage enjoyed by that strategy, thus necessitating a new strategy to maintain said advantage
    
Anti-inductivity is a subset of the cybernetic feedback problem. The latter is the broad phenomenon by which a machine alters its environment through its actions, thus changing its inputs via its outputs. The former is a subset of feedback/reflexivity whereby the environment is changed in a specific way by _adversarial, intelligent agents_ so as to _defang the acting machine's efficacy._
    
Similarly, heuristics/strategies/technologies are fitted to an environment, so when an environment randomly drifts, the strategy/tech is decoupled and loses efficacy. But in surrogation or goodhart problems, _adversarial agents_ deliberately decouple e.g. an assessment heuristic in a specific direction
    
I'm going to call these strategies/solutions/technologies _interventions_.
    
An intervention is fitted to its environment. In open systems, this environment will change over time, altering the intervention's fitness. This change can be caused by: 
1. Forces unrelated to the intervention alter the environment. 
2. Forces whose behavior is altered by the intervention itself. 

Among forces whose behavior is altered by the intervention itself, the alteration can be: 
1. Simple feedback, which occurs deterministically and is, once behavior is accounted for, untethered from the goals of the intervention. 
2. Intelligent response, which occurs as a result of agents whose interests clash or synchronize with the goals of the intervention, and whose adaptive responses undermines or strengthen the intervention's efficacy depending on where their interest lies.
    
One big difference is that intelligent agents don't respond "in the moment" like billiards balls get knocked around—they respond _proactively_. So it's not just that X agents does Y action that clashes with Z's interests. It's often that Y action _appears_ to, or will eventually, lead to results which impact Z, and so they're actually clashing over futures.
    
I guess in some ways intelligence "just is" the incorporation of feedback into its action model. As the agent acts and thereby alters the environment, the environment changes, and the acts needed to reach the end-goal change with it. Systems that are non-intelligent, like a static assessment heuristic that gets implemented as an institutional protocol/ritual, can't stay coupled to their environment as it changes, while intellient, dynamic systems can.
    
And anti-inductivity is what happens when 2+ intelligent agents interact competitively.
    
An illustration of each of the dynamics, using a steersman/rower in the spirit of cybernetics' etymology: 
1. Your rowing heuristic is a simple "one left stroke, one right stroke, repeat" intervention. Suddenly, the wind picks up and starts steering you into the shore; your intervention has been decoupled and must be adapted to still achieve its goal. 
2. Your rowing heuristic is a simple one left, one right alternation again, but as you move forward along the river, its shape changes and curves, such that you'd run ashore if you don't, say, paddle hard-right. 
3. You're rowing along with a partner; your goal is to get the boat to go straight, and theirs is to get the boat to run ashore, and so each of you watch one another, constantly updating your intervention according to what they're doing/what you predict they'll do next.
    
# Hyperstition and the will to believe

[[William James]], [["The Will To Believe"]]:
> Turn now from these wide questions of good to a certain class of questions of fact, questions concerning personal relations, states of mind between one man and another. Do you like me or not?--for example. Whether you do or not depends, in countless instances, on whether I meet you half-way, am willing to assume that you must like me, and show you trust and expectation. The previous faith on my part in your liking's existence is in such cases what makes your liking come. But if I stand aloof, and refuse to budge an inch until I have objective evidence, until you shall have done something apt, as the absolutists say, ad extorquendum assensum meum, ten to one your liking never comcs. How many women's hearts are vanquished by the mere sanguine insistence of some man that they must love him! He will not consent to the hypothesis tbat they cannot. The desire for a certain kind of truth here brings about that special truth's existence; and so it is in innumerable cases of other sorts. Who gains promotions, boons, appointments, but the man in whose life they are seen to play the part of live hypotheses, who discounts them, sacrifices other things for their sake before they have come, and takes risks for them in advance ? His faith acts on the powers above him as a claim, and creates its own verification.
