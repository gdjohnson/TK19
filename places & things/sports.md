[3:07 PM] suspended reason: yeah one thinks libs just clearly get wrong is sports, many of them don't understand it
[3:08 PM] suspended reason: many do obviously, but especially upper middle [[class]] cosmopolitan types, all the signaling points to pure rejection, it goes so deep they're unable to even understand why someone would adopt it
[3:11 PM] suspended reason: but it seems just as important to our culture as art or music, and I mean empirically, the amount of pleasure, the way sports fandom brings people together, the character building and social bonding of even participating in the first place. Having clear cultural models of excellence, dedication, cooperation
[3:11 PM] suspended reason: There's something important about models of value, worth, etc that are meaningfully different that lead to "everybody gets a trophy mentality"
[3:12 PM] suspended reason: Like, the cultural presumption that you're worthless if you don't win a trophy is what lead inevitably to "now we have to give trophies to everyone"
