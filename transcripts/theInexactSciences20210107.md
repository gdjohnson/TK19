[1:47 PM] suspended reason: I still don't understand "the exception that proves the rule"
[1:47 PM] suspended reason: Why would an exception prove a rule
[1:47 PM] suspended reason: Sorry for being Hansonian here, I gotta just assume it maps to some literally untrue but still useful heuristic
[1:54 PM] snav: "the exception that proves the rule" is an extremely common pattern, Zizek talks about it a lot in terms of "ideology"
[1:55 PM] suspended reason: Makes sense, it's how you stay comfortable in absolutes
[1:55 PM] snav: exactly!
[12:04 PM] lambdaphagy: the original sense of "[[the exception proves the rule]]" comes from cicero
[12:05 PM] lambdaphagy: if you see a sign on a particular intersection that says "no right turn on red", that implies that right turns on red are generally allowed
[12:05 PM] lambdaphagy: otherwise you wouldn't have to spell out the exception
[1:05 PM] lambdaphagy: the problem is that "the exception that proves the rule" sounds like it could refer to several other equally plausible heuristics
[1:05 PM] lambdaphagy: my favorite is "an apparent exception that, upon closer inspection, is actually an extremely confirmatory instance"
[1:06 PM] lambdaphagy: A: all irishmen are alcoholics
[1:06 PM] lambdaphagy: B: what about seamus o'leprechaun, he doesn't drink
[1:07 PM] lambdaphagy: A: he had to stop drinking after his liver transplant for cirrhosis
[1:07 PM] lambdaphagy: B: oh
1:10 PM] snav: yeah there's a specific version im describing too, where the question is also non-empirical, because it's a claim about an abstract object in which all the exceptions prove the rule
[1:11 PM] snav: pretty easy to find in stuff like
"America is X"
"well what about when ~X happened?"
"proves nothing, it's un-American"
[1:11 PM] snav: or something like that
[1:11 PM] snav: the internal logic of absolutes
[1:14 PM] suspended reason: I've never heard it used the Cicero way, I usually hear some variation of the "upon closer inspection" heuristic or else just literally using it to say that a legitimate exception somehow proves a rule, which... doesn't follow
[1:14 PM] suspended reason: The Cicero way is good tho, "you only need to specify what contradicts the implicit assumption" is a huge part of how language works ^20d80c
