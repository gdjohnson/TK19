@talyarkoni
every time i read [[William James]] i come away thinking that (i) no other human being has ever been as correct in their core views about the world (adjusting for the times), and (ii) few human beings have ever written prose as boring as [[William James]] did

(ii) is really unfortunate, because if [[William James|James]] had been more clear and concise, a lot of dead end analytical philosophy might have been avoided

@StefanFSchubert
Maybe, but my guess is that that sort of analytic philosophy would have thrived even if it had had better critics 100 years ago. It seems many find it intuitive.

@talyarkoni
yeah you're probably right. though the fact that philosophers hold Wittgenstein in such reverence, despite the fact that he adds essentially nothing to [[William James|James]], leads me to think the presentation might have made a difference

@suspendedreason
I've always felt like, despite [[William James|James]] nailing the different, non-primary "senses" of words (famous squirrel & tree) Wittgenstein's contribution is family resemblance and polysemy, which gives rise to Prototype Theory. Is there James that gestures in that direction?

@talyarkoni
i think this is a nice point to focus on, because it highlights the difference in their orientation/goals. from a psychological/naturalistic POV, Wittgenstein's notion of family resemblance offers almost nothing to work with. it's not a positive theory of categorical perception..

@talyarkoni
..i think it excited philosophers of language mainly because it made a point that [[William James|James]] would have found utterly obvious in a way that philosophers were receptive to—i.e., by pointing out the absurdity of looking for necessary and sufficient criteria.

@talyarkoni
i don't know if [[William James|James]] explicitly discussed this (probably somewhere; he wrote a lot!), but i'm fairly certain his response would have been "well, duh—that's entailed by a pragmatic, usage-focused view". and i think he's right

to [[William James|James]] (or my reading of him), it's entailed by the fact that we affix discrete labels to regularities we observe in the world that there can only (at best) be family resemblances between things

i'm sure there are more directly relevant statements elsewhere, but here's what i could find on a quick dip into principles vol. 2. the point being that [[William James|James]] is focused on the *process* through which we assign labels to things.

Wittgenstein i see as mainly reacting to the dominant [[analyticPhilosophy|analytical tradition]]; he doesn't have a naturalistic program to speak of. so it's natural that he would focus on negative arguments against a semantics of reference. but i don't think it adds anything to what [[William James|James]] wrote.

@StefanFSchubert
Yes, and the fact that he is reacting to the dominant [[analyticPhilosophy|analytical tradition]] - where he of course was a main player - was probably a key reason why his criticisms became so influential.

Plus various other sociological reasons.

@suspendedreason
Is it fair to say his discursive grounding is precisely what makes him more impactful? Tho OTOH I’ve heard [[William James|James]] basically wiped out competing rationalisms of the time by either rebutting or swallowing them hole & incorporating

@suspendedreason
Or is it just as simple as Witt was a European analytic in correspondence with positivism, and Russell taught the positivists to hate American phils

@talyarkoni
there were probably many factors, but i'm sure part of it was that Witt was contemporaneously addressing the [[analyticPhilosophy|analytical tradition]] in its preferred terminology, whereas [[William James|James]] wrote long boring books in naturalese, and was dead by the time these debates were going down

@StefanFSchubert
Quine was a pragmatist, but engaged more directly with the [[analyticPhilosophy|analytical tradition]] (and was part of it himself); in particular with [[Rudolf Carnap|Carnap]]'s work. 

Quine of course had enormous influence on [[analytic philosophy]]

@talyarkoni
yeah. the thing that's both remarkable and depressing about all 3 figures (and all the other pragmatists) is that they made a splash mainly for pointing out how dumb the foundational assumptions of [[analyticPhilosophy|analytic phil]] are—yet those assumptions are still largely in place

@suspendedreason
Are they? I feel like [[conceptual engineering]]'s really taken over lately

That's an assessment as an outsider though; as an insider, do those old necessary-and-sufficient myths seem to remain in place in departments

@talyarkoni
i suppose it's not so surprising. one could say the same for Paul Meehl, Jacob Cohen, etc. in psychology.

it's almost like we need to lionize critics just so we can pretend we did our due diligence as we proceed to completely ignore the real lessons of their work

if anything, the philosophers might be more upstanding actors here. at least a lot of philosophers have spent their careers trying to reject Wittgenstein, Quine, etc., whereas you can count serious push-backs against Meehl and Cohen on probably one hand
