[1:52 PM] **snav**: reading [[Markov blankets]]

[1:52 PM] **snav**: one thing this reminds me of a lot is Reich's "crackpot" theory about life energy

[1:56 PM] **snav**: he got really obsessed with interior/exterior boundary distinctions in biology and tried to expand it to a Theory of Everything

[1:56 PM] **snav**: which is almost exactly what this Friston paper is

[1:57 PM] **snav**: he believed he'd found the principle underlying all life

[1:57 PM] **snav**: although his was less neurological and also very 1930s and not modern lol

[1:58 PM] **snav**: also ill photograh the diagram in the org psych book later, which seems to be specifically and clearly about the way to create and maintain a markov blanket among human groups

[1:58 PM] **snav**: even with recourse to information theory

[2:00 PM] **snav**: adaptive active inference reminds me a lot of Hegel. i feel like he was explicating the process by which it emerges in a human

[2:00 PM] **snav**: it's also why the book is structured as a hierarchical generative model

[2:05 PM] **snav**: the part about the ultimate endgame being to return to the pendulum seems very political, almost

[2:05 PM] **snav**: not in the sense of doing politics but seems to elucidate some driving assumptions underneath politics

[3:04 PM] **snav**: Next step: rewrite all of psychoanalysis in terms of markov blankets

[3:06 PM] **snav**: First and easiest one: Kegan stages are simply the number of nested layers of Markov blankets

[4:02 PM] **suspended reason**: wowwww I would kill for a post reconciling Friston with Reich

[4:02 PM] **suspended reason**: that sounds so based

[4:02 PM] **suspended reason**: it's like exactly right tonally too

[4:02 PM] **suspended reason**: yeah Kegan and Piaget both have stuff that's similar to [[predictive processing]]

[4:03 PM] **suspended reason**: the devpych literature's littered with it, all the way up to Gopnik and theory theory (which is basically [[predictive processing]] with less math)

[4:04 PM] **suspended reason**: do any major psychoanalytic thinkers do anything with information theory? both fields would've been hot at around the same time

[4:04 PM] **suspended reason**: yeah that org psych diagram sounds great, def scan & post

[4:05 PM] **suspended reason**: I was trying to think a lil about that today, boundary maintenance as just a way to ensure all actors are synced up toward the superorganism's goal

[4:05 PM] **suspended reason**: like if you're a company and you let rogue actors in/on your computers, it's countering the superorganism's mission letting that kinda chaos in

[4:05 PM] **suspended reason**: heh like the Ran Prieur June 5 post

[4:07 PM] **suspended reason**: I would love to have a diagram in the world that mapped the kind of "universe" around pp in intellectual discourse, from Kantian inference to devpsych to trauma and psychoanalysis to gestalt theory, hermeneutics, compression, philosophers like Hegel

[4:08 PM] **suspended reason**: it's a cool way to say like, Friston's big idea is one incarnation of a Big Idea that an entire intellectual tradition's been working on

[4:08 PM] **suspended reason**: it appears obvious to the Bayesian brain and LW and Friston types because the entire intellectual discourse has made it linguistically and conceptually available

[4:09 PM] **suspended reason**: and always points out that the details are always the weakest part of these theoriesâ€”it's what connects them, not what makes them specific, that matters

[6:12 PM] **snav**: Hmmm i honestly dont know if any psychoanalysis tangled with information theory but i assume some tried

[6:14 PM] **snav**: that's the basic version but there's more detailed versions too

[6:15 PM] **snav**: basically enactment is defining what constitutes "information", selection is deciding how to act on that information, and retention is adjusting criteria of enactment and selection based on the results of action

[6:15 PM] **snav**: so the mapping is that retention is internal state, enactment is sensory and selection is active

[6:15 PM] **snav**: What's interesting is how the component order is subtly different

[6:21 PM] **snav**: so i guess it's 9pm then?

[6:29 PM] **snav**: also hm https://www.jstor.org/stable/27827855?seq=1

[6:29 PM] **snav**: I'll read over this

[6:42 PM] **snav**: it's really strange to read that mereology essay and see people rederiving Hegel's work from scratch in an inside-out fashion

[6:43 PM] **snav**: And even Hegel himself was drawing from Duns Scotus https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haecceity

> "Haecceity" (; from the Latin haecceitas, which translates as "thisness") is a term from medieval scholastic philosophy, first coined by followers of Duns Scotus to denote a concept that he seems to have originated: the discrete qualities, properties or characteristics of a th...

[6:44 PM] **snav**: Especially interesting how the Duns Scotus page discusses [[Harold Garfinkel|Garfinkel]] (!!) at length

[7:07 PM] **suspended reason**:
 basically enactment is defining what constitutes "information", selection is deciding how to act on that information, and retention is adjusting criteria of enactment and selection based on the results of action
I think this is the best way to describe institutions as "evolutionary," w/r/t earlier convo with RP about Samo

[7:08 PM] **suspended reason**: it's not about evolution across institutions so much as it's about the evolution of decisions, choices, behaviors that occurs over any system's lifespan

[7:09 PM] **snav**: yes! he explicitly describes it as an evolutionarily mechanism!

[7:09 PM] **suspended reason**: you'll have to expand on Hegel and mereology, dunno anything bout it

[7:10 PM] **suspended reason**: wow I need to learn more concepts from medieval epistemology

[7:10 PM] **snav**: basically a Thing is constitued by a motion of pointing out This-s and Here-s and Now-s, coupled with a negation, an explication of Not This-s, which forms the boundary between the Thing and the Non Thing

[7:11 PM] **snav**: but yeah Duns Scotus. based

[7:12 PM] **snav**: (well, kinda ... that's the sense perceived thing. the other side is force acting on itself, in an argument i can't quite explain)
