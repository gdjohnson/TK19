[2:32 PM] snav: what might fall into that category?
[2:33 PM] suspended reason: Well, hmmm.
[2:33 PM] suspended reason: Expression is certainly produced by action but there's a difference between chopping a tree down with physical force and the information that's transmitted
[2:33 PM] suspended reason: Gets back to the Bateson
[2:34 PM] suspended reason: I think I'm not totally clear on the relationship between action and expression
[2:34 PM] snav: we can bracket that one for now if we want to focus on expression v communication
[2:34 PM] suspended reason: Maybe they are more like parallel tracks of altering the world
[2:34 PM] suspended reason: What's left?
[2:35 PM] snav: it seems like a difficult question -- i would probably go back to Schutz and think about phenomenology in order to figure out the delineation
[2:35 PM] snav: because Schutz spent a lot of time clarifying what is an "action"
[2:36 PM] snav: backtracking to this: I want to dig into the idea of "the goal" here
[2:37 PM] snav: our ability to ascribe a goal, unless we insist that goals be conscious (which they often arent), depends basically on our hermeneutic style, which means there's some aspect of us "doing our own reading" i.e. imposing an intent on the expressor
[2:37 PM] snav: so in this sense the idea of communication is inherently intersubjective (i.e. determined by the relation between the producer and us as interpreter), whereas expression does not require us to define a motive
[2:39 PM] suspended reason: To ascribe a goal period (as opposed to e.g. ascribing a specific goal)?
[2:40 PM] snav: i feel like this reveals a ground assumption of this entire theory, which is that actions have goals
[2:40 PM] suspended reason: Yes
[2:40 PM] snav: and this is in line with Schutz's distinction between the Act and mere "Behavior"
[2:40 PM] suspended reason: Or actions have reasons, at least
[2:40 PM] snav: where Behavior is automatic and lacks a goal
[2:41 PM] snav: so we might be tempted to say that Henry Darger's work is "behavior" but i feel like that is not necessarily true
[2:41 PM] suspended reason: If there's automatic behavior, it's probably ritualistically or evolutionarily fulfilling a function, I'd imagine
[2:41 PM] snav: i would connect it up psychologically to Freud's idea of repetition (taken up much later by Deleuze), if we wanted to get causal, in the sense that we repeat patterns over and over again (i.e. the basis of Death Drive)
[2:42 PM] snav: a good anecdote is when I visited Bowser, and he was telling me about how his cats did this sort of claw scratching motion based on certain triggers, which they'd picked up as street cats but never "unlearned"
[2:42 PM] snav: + also DC Barker's great post on "how i psychoanalyzed my dog"
[2:42 PM] suspended reason: IDK about death drive, but I know people do habits for reasons, and even if in a given situation, the habit is "ill-fitted" or brings about some undesired end, considered at the macro, the habit is purposive
[2:43 PM] suspended reason: Yeah
[2:43 PM] suspended reason: so the so-called trauma angle of misfitted behavior is very real I think
[2:43 PM] snav: https://psuedoanalysis.blogspot.com/2020/05/the-minor-science-of-caninepistemology.html
The Minor Science of Caninepistemology / Doggypsychiatry
A blog that covers topics of Nick Land, Hyperstition, Accelerationism, Mark Fisher, Psychoanalysis, Felix Guattari, Schizoanalysis
[2:43 PM] snav: i think this blog post is brilliant
[2:43 PM] suspended reason: but it's sorta like claiming masturbation doesn't serve a purpose (the purpose is the surrogate)
[2:44 PM] snav: the question of proximate cause vs final cause is pretty deep
[2:44 PM] suspended reason: lolol doggypsychiatry
[2:44 PM] snav: repetition is more of a proximate cause, but if we follow the chain of "whys" we can probably make an evolutionary argument re "final" or "first" cause, but that's also where theology shows up 
[2:45 PM] snav: and tbh i'm less interested personally in final causes than in the formal structure of the classifications we're making here 
[2:45 PM] snav: mainly because i feel like final cause is not necessary for the usefulness/pragmatics of these theories
[2:46 PM] suspended reason: Here's maybe a clarification: I don't think literally all utterances/communication acts are attempts to manipulate a given situation/receiver (some can be ritualistic, some can be self-stimming/anxiolytic, etc). But the purpose of communication, as a practice or behavior, is manipulation, such that I think there's grounds to say either "they're doing it wrong"/making a mistake (e.g. to someone who is self-stimming in public) or to say that such a person isn't actually engaging in communication
[2:46 PM] suspended reason: Should I read this now or? Will take me am in
[2:46 PM] snav: it's pretty short
[2:46 PM] snav: i recommend giving it a read
[2:46 PM] snav: will take you ~10min max
[2:47 PM] snav: what i want to bring up wrt this is Schutz's distinction between "polythetic" vs "monothetic" (his words) decision making, where when we perform an action, we often have a set of parallel reasons, which becomes "condensed" (my word) into a monothetic self-interpretation of motive
[2:48 PM] snav: so the structure here would be something like "my communication has N different reasons" and then we post-hoc justify our communication as having 1 reason, based on "how it comes across"
[2:50 PM] suspended reason:
You bring your dog in, the vet looks at it for a minute, gives a diagnosis based on incredibly limited information generated from abstract models of knowledge, then prescribes general medicine. If the meds work, the diagnosis was correct, and there is no reason to reflect. If the meds don't work, prescribe more meds, test more, and there is no reason to reflect. There is no true, rigorous way of testing the effect of vet treatments, and the vet has no incentive to get it right the first time because they'd rather rope you back in once a week over the next two months to up the doses, charging you each time.
[2:51 PM] suspended reason: He compares this to 19th C psychiatry, but isn't is also true of 21st C psychiatry lol?
[2:51 PM] snav: yes
[2:53 PM] snav:
In this sense, 21st century veterinary mirrors 19th century psychiatry
[2:53 PM] snav: i think he would also agree that 21st century psychiatry is similar
[2:53 PM] snav: (treated more strictly as medicinal)
[2:58 PM] suspended reason: OK I've read
[2:58 PM] suspended reason: it was cool lol
[2:58 PM] snav: yeah i think about that case study a lot
[2:59 PM] snav: because i think it reveals the "bare" structure of some of these seemingly complicated ideas
[2:59 PM] suspended reason: Right, right, def
[3:00 PM] snav: his other post i think about a lot is the one on dream interpretation and hermeneutics
[3:00 PM] suspended reason: Yeah, so insofar as I mean communication is manipulation, I mean it in the same sense that, e.g., if you asked a compulsive hand-washer why he was washing his hands, he'd say "to make sure they're clean!"
[3:01 PM] suspended reason: Or if I always get up early to open the storefront for employees, and one morning I forget it's Veteran's Day and show up and unlock the door, and someone says, "Why are you opening the door?" I'd say, "To let the employees in!"
[3:01 PM] snav: right -- in this sense the utterance reveals some belief
[3:02 PM] suspended reason: Right. It's not that we're these perfectly rational agents. But we have beliefs and rationales, we almost never I think "do things for no reason"—and even if you ask someone who's doing X activity, "You know X is pointless, why are you doing it," they might say, "I know, I know, it's so pointless it doesn't accomplish anything"—here my guess is a part of them does believe it accomplishes something, even if their conscious self won't admit to it socially
[3:03 PM] snav: my main question is "to what extent are we justified in attributing a specific motive to an act of communication?" given that we assume all communication "is motivated"
[3:04 PM] suspended reason: The bit we haven't gotten into is monothetical vs polythetical
[3:04 PM] suspended reason: Right, ok, similar question, yeah?
[3:04 PM] snav: sure yeah related
[3:06 PM] suspended reason: So what might some of those other motivations be?
[3:06 PM] suspended reason: I suppose I might agree that e.g. people might say things in conversations because it "makes them feel better to say it" (e.g.) totally separate from the effect that it has on the conversation. But I'm also sorta skeptical of this—I hear it constantly in cases where it's clear that yes, the person is trying to alter the conversation, they just wanna pretend they're not.
[3:06 PM] snav: (also unfortunately i gotta prepare for a drive back to Brooklyn so can't talk too much longer)
[3:06 PM] suspended reason: ah word word
[3:07 PM] snav: the main situation i want to propose is that someone could (not necessarily consciously) do an act of communication (make a move) that could potentially have multiple outcomes depending on the recipients response/interpretation
[3:07 PM] suspended reason: It seems like speech can really only have effects agents that can receive it, and either other people are the receiver, or "you" are (e.g. in the anxiety case)
[3:07 PM] suspended reason: Which sorta limits the range of motivations—it's either for you or it's for other people
[3:07 PM] snav: e.g. chess openings
[3:07 PM] suspended reason: Ah I see
[3:08 PM] suspended reason: Yeah, Crispy's always advocated a "steering" metaphor that I sorta like, that we steer in directions that feel better, and away from directions that we think might lead bad places
[3:08 PM] snav: and then, for Schutz, what happens is that the space of possible interpretation is "rectified" (my word) by the recipients interpretation
[3:08 PM] suspended reason: e.g. I might not bring up X subject with parents not because I have some concrete sense of what could happen that's bad, but the unknown unknowns, it feeling "unsafe"
[3:08 PM] snav: and post-hoc explained as "having always meant that"
[3:08 PM] snav: hmm but there's also the idea of making a risky statement but couched in a less risky interpretation
[3:08 PM] Neil: this is the in-order-to vs. because thing you mentioned?
[3:08 PM] suspended reason: rectified is an interesting word
[3:09 PM] snav: (closely related but this is a diff portion of the text)
[3:09 PM] suspended reason: Yeah, I definitely think people's responses aren't easily gamed, so we can only manipulate approximately, crudely, etc
[3:10 PM] suspended reason: "Maybe if I steer the convo in this direction, they'll bring up their company and mention job offerings"
[3:10 PM] snav: right, although there's also this sense of openness which i prefer, of the "let me bring this up and i'll see what happens"
[3:10 PM] snav: without a clear intent in mind
[3:10 PM] suspended reason: Yeah
[3:11 PM] snav: (which is sort of what i'm doing now, although i do have an intent of clarifying the structures involved here) 
[3:12 PM] suspended reason: I think there's a huge range in how narrow vs. general, predetermined vs undetermined, people are willing to leave outcomes. Discovery mindset vs. agenda. I just think that "I want them to say what comes to their mind, so we can have a good conversation about our honest feelings" is manipulation just like "I want them to agree drop me off after work" is
[3:12 PM] suspended reason: I should probably write a blog post about this
[3:12 PM] suspended reason: I sorta did above, but it's more adjacent than precisely about this
[3:12 PM] suspended reason: "Railroading" would be a good term to pick up here maybe
[3:13 PM] suspended reason: Especially b/c I think most good conversation between peers is relatively open in this way, not having a pre-determined agenda (which you can often feel/gets annoying in casual interpersonal life—ritual and institutionalization helps normalize this stuff typically)
[3:14 PM] snav: the interesting thing about your blog post is that the manipulation takes place in relation to the agent's fantasy (belief/expectation)
[3:14 PM] suspended reason: But like, when I ask you a question, it's to get you to respond and share information. Or if you post a link, it's to get me to read it. When I tell you something, it's so that you'll acknowledge my point in the conversation and change your course of argument to incorporate it
[3:15 PM] suspended reason: very vacuous and banal manipulation heh
[3:15 PM] snav: unfortunately i do gotta run now
[3:15 PM] snav: but i think we've raised some interesting points
[3:16 PM] suspended reason: Emoji—a classic manipulation trick of meeting your duties to engage, while exerting less effort than a full response 😆
[3:16 PM] suspended reason: Have a safe drive!
[3:16 PM] suspended reason: Good chattin
[3:16 PM] snav: lmao, thanks!! 🙏
