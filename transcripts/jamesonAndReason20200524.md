**REASON**

Re: intentionalist, I like the quote about meaning as empirical [[intent]], but why don’t we just call that “intended meaning,” and say that in trying to find out an intended meaning, readers come to a “reader meaning” that differs? Why contest the concept of “meaning” as a monolith?

**JAMESON**
For Knapp & Michaels, meaning is synonymous with authorial [[intent|intention]] (as opposed to de Man, who assigns meaning to how readers receive the text). So for K&M, there can’t be “reader meaning.” Readers either figure out what authors meant, or they don’t (or they grasp some of it)... I should add that the current landscape of English departments might be something like 95% some form of poststructuralism, 5% intentionalism? (Inasmuch as people in said departments think/care about these things.) Michaels calls intentionalism “the Dark Side.”

**REASON** 
Ok, ok, but isn’t the point of Star Wars that the dark & light exist as part of the same flowing force? That they balance each other? I guess what I’m asking is: there seems to be such a thing as a reader interpretation, and such thing as an intended author meaning. Why fight over which should be called the text’s “Meaning” instead of just calling them different things, and acknowledging they’re both important parts of the full literary process?

**JAMESON**

The way I understand this question is, why are there three different positions—structuralism, poststructuralism, intentionalism—instead of there being instead a single position, which locates meaning in all three places (text, reader, author)?

**REASON**

Yes, I think that’s a fair rewording. I don’t necessarily think formalism (meaning “in language”) should get its due, since it seems unclear whether its fair to attribute “meaning” to language itself rather than speakers/interpreters, but broadly, yes—why not reconcile the positions?

**JAMESON**

I’m sure people have tried to reconcile the positions in various ways. If so, though, I know less about that. That said, I’m not sure a true reconciliation is possible.

A central tenet of structuralism was that texts had singular meanings. [[intent|Intentionalists]] believe that, too. Poststructuralists, tho, believe texts don’t (can’t) have fixed, singular meanings.
It seems one has to choose between those positions—single meaning or multiple meanings.

What’s more, the poststructualist position tends to decay into texts having not just multiple meanings, but infinite meanings. Which is to say that the poststructuralist position tends to decay into texts being meaningless. (Thinking that a text means anything is a fantasy.) Some theorists (e.g., Stanley Fish, Barbara Herrnstein-Smith) have tried to put a break on that “drift,” but without much success. So in some ways, the choice is between texts having a singular meaning, or no meaning whatsoever.

**REASON, SIDEBAR** 

While Jameson's descriptions of the various positions are all well-elucidated, we are still left wondering: what is the actual subject of their disagreement? Explicitly, the debate appears to be: What is textual meaning? Is it the reader’s interpretation, the author’s [[intent]], or contained in the structure of the language? Implicitly, the debate is over which stages of the literary process (from production to reception) ought to be granted scholarly authority & attention.

We can say a few things fairly definitely: that readers have interpretations and that authors have intents. Though each side minimizes the role of interpretation and [[intent]], respectively, in their picture of the literary process, neither would flat-out deny the existence of intent or interpretation—only whether it constitutes the text’s “meaning” or not. Thus we are left with what appears to be, at least explicitly, a verbal dispute. (The implicit question of where to direct attention and study is an important one, and not merely verbal, but the answer is more nuanced than “always to interpretation” or “always to intention"—as usual, it depends what you’re trying to ascertain with respect to the text or society; there is no “authority” absent our granting it, and our granting must be goal-driven.)

It is also clear that readers’ interpretations are informed and guided by the structure of the language, and that they are also frequently "up to” the business of guessing author [[intent]]. (This is the dynamic that allows one side—intentionalism—to claim that this intent is “authoritative” and reader interpretations are “not” the meaning but its approximations or corruptions.) Thus we are left with a picture of factions not just warring over the “land” of the concept handle “meaning,” but of each side’s preferred sense having a dynamic interrelation with the other—that all parts of the process of constructing and interpreting texts are bound up as the same process. An author writes with an understanding of how he will be interpreted in mind; he constantly defers to a model of a reader, which may be proxied by his own private sense of the language or else some structure “in” the language itself, however misleading that frame may be. A reader reads with an understanding that the author understands how the reader might interpret it; there is recursion here, in the [[theory of mind|mutual modeling]]. The readers look for clues as to a readers intent just as the author crafts them with respect to how they will be interpreted. This negotiation is the same negotiation as in daily language; it is not particular to literary texts, though of course the level of deliberation (by speaker) and deciphering (by receiver) is much higher. “Meaning” is and has always been a polysemous term; there is no “essence” to it, there are many senses, related by impossible to reduce. And any side which “narrows” the whole to its preferred carving is only impoverishing our total picture.

Thus, what we need is hermeneutic compatibilism, between intention and interpretation. A. D. J. sees the different positions as irreconcilable because he has reified the term “meaning” into being a “real thing in the world” which different factions have different hypotheses about. This is not the case. Rather, “meaning” is a handle with many senses, used by different people to describe different statuses of the text’s “signal” as it traverses the literary production-reception process. Each faction is led through the natural incentives of (social) discourse into over-emphasizing their sense of the handle as its “whole,” its “essence,” the “true” sense of the term. So when Jameson says, for example, that intentionalism perceives “meaning” as singular, while poststructuralism sees it as indeterminate or multiplicitous, he misses that the sides are not arguing about the same meaning. There is no conflict in argument because there is no agreement on terms; the sides are talking past each other, as they have now for a hundred years. It is “meaning” in the sense of author [[intent]] that is singular, and “meaning” in the sense of reader interpretation that is multiplicitous, the original signal being “converted” or “decompressed” into different meanings by individuals with different interpretive schemas. To accept that there is a “singular” author-intended meaning is a claim in no actual conflict with the claim that there are “many” reader-interpreted meanings, and vice-versa.

While I happily concede that a great deal of work is being done by the “implicit” framing of the argument—that there is still “progress” happening among the confusions of what is essentially conceptual analysis—I do not think that a muddled explicit factoring of the debate leads anyone to clarity. Conceptual engineer “meaning” and be done with it. (I recommend “[[divide-and-conquer]]” over “narrow-and-conquer” for a plethora of reasons.)

**JAMESON**

FWIW, it took me a while to grasp the argument Knapp and Michaels made in "Against Theory." Indeed, I struggled with that essay off and on throughout the first full year of my Ph.D., much to the amusement of Walter Benn Michaels. (That may just be me. I was at the time more or less a deconstructionist, adhering to something like Stanley Fish's reader-response theory, with perhaps swirls of Barthes mixed in.) (The relevant context here is that Michaels has known Fish for decades, since they were both at Berkeley in the 1970s. Fish later hired Michaels at UIC c. 2005, when Fish was the Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. I attended UIC for my PhD in large part because of this history—deconstruction and formalism were my primary intellectual interests in the 2000s.) (I got turned on to the topic in my Master's degree, where I primarily studied with Curtis White, who studied deconstruction with Gayatri Spivak.)

My current understanding of the relationship between formalism and deconstruction is that the former will always collapse or decay into the latter (assuming that by formalism one means that texts possess stable, self-sufficient meanings that are guaranteed by the norms of language themselves, which is essentially the New Critical position). I don't think there's any way around that, despite the numerous attempts that different critics have made over the years to prevent that, whether it's Fish or Hirsch, or anyone else. Michaels convinced me that formalism has always been essentially a fantasy, and that there's really just deconstruction, as long as one believes that meaning is somehow inside the text by virtue of it being inside language. His solution to that problem (namely that the only valid theoretical position is deconstruction) is the intentionalist position, that it's a mistake to think that meaning is inside the text, and inside language (in any kind of inherent or essential capacity).

Which is also to say I spent several years arguing with Michaels before he finally convinced me! But he lives for debate, and is used to people telling him he's wrong.

**REASON**

I agree formalism is a fantasy! But I think there are things that a text can "testify" to that are not intended by its author, which can justifiably be called part of its "meaning." For instance, getting away from language in the narrow sense, there is a rich semiotics of fashion. And a piece of clothing can "mean" something, very clearly, in a way the wearer did not intend. Which merely means that there are established associations (e.g. between class or subculture and a garment) that are real and understood and possibly even conventional, which the wearer (the "speaker" of the clothing) may be entirely ignorant of. And to say that these aren't a part of the "meaning" of the clothing ensemble is basically to make a lexicographic or definitional argument about what "meaning" is.

If someone wanted to carve this up into information which is "intended" and information which is "evidenced," I'd have no problem—but it seems unambiguous that there is "information" in the evidence cases, e.g. in the fashion example, and that the information "means" something in a nontrivial way

**JAMESON**

re: the formalism part, by all means, check out Michaels' "Against Formalism." That text went a long way toward helping me understand the debate between formalism and deconstruction. (The exam paper I wrote, in fact, was on that very issue, and had less to do with intentionalism per se.)

As for the rest, the argument you're making here isn't incompatible with intentionalism. Indeed, I'd say [[intent|intentionalism]] does a better job accounting for this sort of problem than deconstruction does (which is part of why I switched from being a deconstructionist to an intentionalist).

**REASON**

Well, doesn't Knapp/Michaels say outright, "Meaning IS the intended meaning, full stop"?

**JAMESON**

Yes. In intentionalism, meaning is synonymous with intention.

**REASON**

And so what do we do with all the information a text evidences about itself that is not intended? What do we call that? Is it worth analyzing? (I assume so.)

**JAMESON**

[[intent|Intentionalism]] would call it something other than meaning (it depends on what information it is), and it is for sure worth analyzing. Indeed, this is one of the advantages of intentionalism, I think—it doesn't reduce all information into meaning (as is more the case in formalism / deconstruction).

There's a useful section about this in "Against Formalism" that I always go back to. Michaels is writing there about how what makes formalism a fantasy is its belief that meaning is "intrinsic"—inside language itself, regardless of whatever use we make of it.

[[intent|Intentionalism]] doesn't argue that meaning isn't associative. Indeed, meaning can only ever be associative—we associate meaning with a particular word, or symbol, or article of clothing. The question rather is over whether the meaning is inside that word / symbol / clothing, or inside our action of making the association.

This is why I think Michaels is right to describe intentionalism as being "against theory." Formalism and deconstruction are, above all else, theories about how meaning subsides inside other things, and as such becomes an intrinsic part of them (whether that's words, texts, articles of clothing, and so on). [[intent|Intentionalism]] recategorizes meaning as an entirely empirical matter—abductive, not deductive. "My friend texted me to go to hell, but what did she mean by that? Was she joking, or was she serious?"

In formalism/deconstruction, you look up the words in a dictionary, see what they mean, and that's what the text means. In intentionalism, meaning is more about what people are using words (and other things) to mean. We have to figure it out.

**REASON**

Ah I see I see. I think this comes closer to clearing some things up then that we've disagreed over in the past. It seems like we agree then that at some level, intentionalism vs reader-response/theories of indeterminacy is a verbal dispute: do you define "meaning" as [[intent]], or all relevant information, or relative to a reader, etc. Obviously there is an interpretation that a reader comes away with that differs from intent; obviously there is information in the text that the author didn't intend; the question is what we file under the name "meaning."

For instance, if (say) intentionalism never existed, and instead a school of thought came forward that said, "let's separate out intended meaning as a subset of all meaning, where all meaning is just any information in a text that signifies, and also emphasize that much of what we care about in interpretation is intended meaning"—hypothetically, that would serve equally well, yeah? And here it would be valid and coherent to say, well, the meaning to Jenny is X, and the meaning to the author is Y, and these are perfectly compatible given that in each case, we're talking about a different type of meaning?

I suppose why I push on this because it does seem like, in popular parlance, when people use the word "meaning," they often see it as perfectly coherent even in the absence of an [[intent]]. I know Knapp/Michaels push back on this, but e.g., showing up to a wedding terribly underdressed and drunk can still "mean" that you're a loser even if you're not intending to get that impression across. There's a real way that the information that gets across, even if not intended, is the meaning. But I'd be curious your intuitions; I don't think there's necessarily a problem in saying, "we're gonna limit the formal use of the word meaning in literary theory to specifically this subset of use cases"—but it does seem like, implicitly, this semantic narrowing is happening under the guise of equivalence. Michael/Knapps saying "intended meaning IS meaning" feels a bit like saying, "brown bread IS bread." Nah, bread is bread, right? If you have to add a qualifier, you've already admitted that you're narrowing the meaning.

**JAMESON**

Just so you know, I'm helping my girlfriend edit a piece of writing she has to turn in, but I'll get to these new messages soon! And I'm happy to keep chatting about all this. It's refreshing, in fact. Few people ever want to discuss it!

**JAMESON**

Hey! I'm back. The past week turned out to be a busy one, but I think I've got a handle on things now.

You're absolutely right that the intentionalist argument is an argument over what should count as meaning. Knapp and Michaels are arguing for a more restricted definition of it, and are trying to sort it out from all kinds of other things that commonly get glommed together as "meaning" (either in casual parlance, or academic jargon).

It's worth remembering that this whole debate got started c. 1946, when Monroe and Beardsley published "The Intentional Fallacy," and ruled authorial intention out of bounds when it comes to interpreting what a text means. Their argument—the formalist fantasy—was that readers didn't need access to the author, because the text alone was sufficient. In their view, the meaning was wholly present in the text, and guaranteed by the norms of language. If readers didn't know what a word meant, they could just go look it up. Once they knew what all the words meant, they'd know what the text meant. They didn't need to go ask the author.

Their purpose in doing this was to settle debates over interpretation—what texts meant. They wanted a scientific, definitive account, underwritten by their commitment to structuralist linguistics. The deconstructionists showed conclusively (I think) why that account is entirely fantastical. And here it's worth noting that Michaels started out as a deconstructionist. He agreed with Derrida and De Man's critiques of the formalists. Hence "Against Formalism." In fact, Michaels considers his account of intentionalism nearly identical to Paul de Man's account of deconstruction. He takes a lot of perverse glee in telling people that he and de Man are largely in agreement.

Where Michaels breaks from the deconstructionists, though, is that Derrida and de Man think the reader determines the meaning of the text. In Derrida's case, texts are overstuffed with meanings, because language is polysemous. To read is always to misread, because the reader is selecting certain readings from a wide available number of them. (Barthes's account is similar.) De Man disagreed with Derrida, thinking texts inherently meaningless, but the effect is still the same: in his account, the reader assigns or invents a meaning for the text when they receive it.

Michaels credits de Man with that insight—that the mistake all along has been to think of the meaning as being inside the text, inside the languge, when in fact (in his view, and in de Man's view), language and texts are intrinsically meaningless (not intrinsically meaningful, as Derrida and the New Critics and other formalists/structuralists argued). Put another way, Michaels thinks Derrida was the only true formalist or structuralist—the only one who saw the project through to the end, and saw how it will always end in deconstruction. Deconstruction is the true formalist account. If you believe meaning inherent in language, then one is forced to conclude that texts are inherently unstable, and always changing in their meanings. Drift is the natural state of things.

Michaels thinks de Man's account of language was right, but that he didn't go far enough, or that he drew the wrong conclusion. He often says that he agrees with de Man right up until the end, at which point de Man breaks in favor of the reader determining what a text means, whereas Michaels breaks in favor of the author. But of course as you point out, meaning isn't the only thing we care about when it comes to texts. Authors can intend a text to mean something, but there's no guarantee that they'll be understood. And they can only try and intend something within specific historical contexts. So for example, Tommy Wiseau intended his 2003 movie The Room to be received as a drama, but no one took it that way. When Wiseau saw how everyone was treating it as a comedy, he said that's what he'd intended all along. But of course he was lying, going with the flow. (This tracks, I think, with your example of the under-dressed, drunk wedding guest.)

When people try doing meaningful things, whether it's speaking, or writing texts, or dressing for formal events, or making artworks (and so on), they're always doing so within a given social context. In that regard, intentionalism is a form of historicism (which is another reason why it's anti-formalist). Intentionalism argues that in order to understand a text, you have to understand what its author intended in a given time and place.

But authors of texts (etc.) can and do misunderstand things, make mistakes, and lack a clear understanding of their time and place, and all its politics and social interactions. We're all blinded to at least some extent by ideology, unable to think entirely outside the strictures of our own socioeconomic moment. Intentionalism accounts for this in a way I think it's impossible for desconstruction to ever do (since in deconstruction, the text immediately escapes its author, becoming unstuck in time, taking on a life of its own).

That, more than anything else, was what convinced me to move from deconstruction to intentionalism. I think intentionalism does a better job accounting for all the things texts are and do, precisely by producing a sharper definition of meaning, and separating it from everything else. The mistake is to conflate all signification as meaning. Which, again, for clarity's sake, is the original sin of formalism.

That's a mouthful so I'll stop there, see if this is clearer, as well as what you think. I'm eager to hear your thoughts! Also, I hope you're doing well.
