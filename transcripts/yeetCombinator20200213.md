[4:23 PM] yeetgenstein: Ribbonfarm seems like a harmless grazing ground for rationalist blog readers

[4:24 PM] yeetgenstein: I just think the “PiPeLiNe To FaSciSm” thing is overblown

[4:38 PM] beiser: i’ve met a lot of people who literally are fascists and love ssc

[4:39 PM] beiser: i think it’s weird that we don’t have a real, studied explainer of the pipeline but SSC does basically make them feel smart and also is extremely circumspect about actually challenging their beliefs

[4:40 PM] beiser: scott is usually pretty reasonable and i don’t want to make him out as a boogeyman but some aspersions do deserve casting here

[4:41 PM] yeetgenstein: After wasting several hours today thinking about SSC, I have finally logged off of twitter and will try to stop thinking about this dumb topic now

[4:42 PM] yeetgenstein: I have some blog post ideas that I want to write up and I should do that instead of doing more pointless discourse

[4:43 PM] beiser: fair

[4:43 PM] beiser: efficient outrage hypothesis: if you’re hearing about it, it’s already a dogpile

[4:44 PM] beiser: i didn’t read the piece

[4:45 PM] sarahzrf: imagine caring enough about sth in the nyt to bother figuring out how to circumvent their paywall / private browsing wall

[4:46 PM] djmicrobeads: rats need to go outside

[4:53 PM] beiser: me when i discover rodents in my kitchen

[6:32 PM] suspended reason: Yeah that closer line on substack made me go holy shit. Only a thin veneer of neutrality

[6:33 PM] suspended reason: Love that they interviewed a leading sneer club member and self declared enemy of Scott as a neutral "scholar" of the rationalist community

[6:33 PM] suspended reason: All this said I think the piece is net good

[6:33 PM] suspended reason: It lays out the basic blue tribe gray tribe frame

[6:34 PM] suspended reason: In fact you could even do a straussian read of it as signaling to potential converts

[6:34 PM] suspended reason: There will be a non trivial number of people who come across the piece, go "I'm not alone?" And get pilled

[6:37 PM] suspended reason: Pretty easy, same system as any other paywall, a JS snippet a vpn or just use archive.org

[6:39 PM] suspended reason: I'm gonna take yalls speculative pipelines about as seriously as I take "marijuana is a gateway drug": probably somewhat real, probably somewhat overblown, but beside the point because it's prohibition that drives potheads to drug dealers, not the other way around.

[6:50 PM] suspended reason: I’m gonna get explicit rather than hide behind  [[ambiguity]] or [[plausibility|plausible]] deniability—Why do people start reading Scott (pot) and Yarvin (H)? Is it because they hate Jews, or are secretly monarchists? No. It’s because they live in a pretty hardcore [[preference falsification]] regime that is the urban, liberal coasts right now, and it’s driving them a little crazy and then they stumble upon SSC or something and go, “oh. I’m not totally nuts. Here’s this reasonable, articulate person who, while being at least seemingly fair and charitable to regime (far more charitable or fair, we imagine, than the regime would be to him), is able to verbalize my problems with said regime, and ask compelling questions I don’t know the answer to w/r/t certain ideological incoherences or contradictions or gaps in the regime’s orthodoxy.”

[6:52 PM] suspended reason: You don’t have to go looking for this psychological explanation; most longform-devouring rationalists will just tell it to you, I see these kinds of testimonials regularly on Twitter (eg Selentechia most recently); it’s the narrative Yarvin uses for himself & friends; people talk about Czeslaw Milosz and McCarthyism; Hannah Arendt quotes are passed around on Twitter. (& If you don’t think coastal cities, and especially academic + youth culture scenes in coastal communities, are ideologically hegemonic, I don’t know what to tell you—longer conversation)

[6:54 PM] suspended reason: But if you wanna fix the war on drugs, you don’t prohibit drugs, that never works. Prohibit drugs, send in undercover cops to break up dealer rings, you'll get some bad guys, you'll do some effective deterrence, sure, but you also fuck up a lot of innocent people's lives, and you make some people's lives really hard for no reason, and it fuels underground black markets and weird class hypocrisy, it's a big mess.

[6:59 PM] suspended reason: People get "pilled" because smug holders of the dominant ideology don't hold them for rigorous (or even coherent reasons), go around smugly acting like they have the one lens on truth, and never feel the need to actually rigorously argue for and justify these beliefs against criticism. Which means you encounter one argument out there more coherent or compelling than the one you live inside, culturally—when you realize you can actually have a dissenting opinion, that maybe the problem is more complex than you've been led or told to believe, etc etc, this stuff, Scott and then Yarvin, it feels liberating

[6:59 PM] suspended reason: That's the high

[7:00 PM] suspended reason: The situation is almost worse than the war on drugs, because where heroin is just inherently amazing feeling, not so Moldbug

[7:01 PM] suspended reason: There's a whole class of benevolent dictator problems he's just toooootally not dealing with; he handwaves away the logistical problems as if they were a technicality, but the whole reason people are opposed to benevolent dictatorships is because they think the logistics are too hard; in other words, he's a cheerleader at best

[7:01 PM] similaralterity: Freebasing samizdat

[7:01 PM] suspended reason: But no, we can't just deal with Yarvin that way, we have to cancel him

[7:02 PM] similaralterity: Is that what the wall of text is saying i ain't reading that

[7:02 PM] suspended reason: And that just makes the problem worse

[7:02 PM] suspended reason: I haven't read sam[ ]zdat if you're referring to the blogger

[7:02 PM] similaralterity: (jk, I'm just trying to do something so I will read later...)

[7:02 PM] similaralterity: No i mean literally getting high from reading what one perceives as samizdat

[7:02 PM] suspended reason: oh yes

[7:03 PM] suspended reason: exactly

[7:09 PM] suspended reason: The situation here is, a pot dealer has sold pot but, also, written a very long, very convincing "Anti-hard drugs FAQ" in which he argues against buying or using heroin, coke, and similar—and people are going, well, but he didn't stop selling to buyers (readers) of his who were also using H (reactionaries), so how serious was he about this whole anti-hard drugs platform anyway?

[7:11 PM] suspended reason: That said, I think it would be interesting to know the pipeline, it would be hard to find out other than randomized interviewing, but seems possible, Twitter DMs are a thing, tho you hit selection bias problems.

[7:11 PM] suspended reason: The point is that the gateway mechanism is, classically, enabled by prohibition—not vice-versa.
