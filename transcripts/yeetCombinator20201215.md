[11:07 AM] suspended reason: The VBW guys are just close enough to being Good that it pains me

[11:08 AM] suspended reason: You can feel them, in an episode, starting to escape the watery tentacles of their institutional ideologies, but they never quite get clearance

[11:09 AM] beau: i'll admit a fondness for dave

[11:32 AM] suspended reason: yeah I've read some of his thoughts on learning that 15 years of his life were dedicated to fake effects

[11:33 AM] suspended reason: pretty brutal

[11:34 AM] suspended reason: wish I could dig it up now

[11:35 AM] suspended reason: Disgust response and homophobia, [[stereotype]] threat, implicit bias I think were some of the big ones—like, there's a theme here

[11:35 AM] suspended reason: And then they go on a podcast and say "yeah, our studies in psych are basically a performance, putting on a show"

[11:36 AM] suspended reason: And you go, cmon, you're so close, just inch a step further you can do it

[11:38 AM] similaralterity: was it his PhD or something?

[11:38 AM] similaralterity: What's that

[11:41 AM] suspended reason: The idea that a significant part of the knowledge production engine is more or less political [[justification]] for its occupying ideology

[11:42 AM] beiser: i'm fascinated by Steven Pinker because he feels like the only figure who really seems self-aware about that

[11:43 AM] beiser: having now transitioned entirely from things that were plausibly social psych to pure ideology production

[11:45 AM] suspended reason: Yeah it's true. I just wish our discourse was able to hang one or two levels of abstraction higher, like, "is a society with a pessimistic or optimistic stance more precarious?"

[11:45 AM] suspended reason: Ideologies that aren't grounded in some pragmatic function tend to flounder

[11:46 AM] beiser: and also in that Pinker is very explicit in mediating between the ideology production and the political occupation—not a coincidence that he was always hanging with Epstein

[11:49 AM] suspended reason: Then what I really want from Tamler is him to start drawing continuities between honor and so-called dignity cultures

[11:50 AM] suspended reason: Because I think he leans to heavily on trying to distinguish, without really getting to the kernel they share, which is reputation management and optics optimization, how ubiquitous and unconscious these tendencies are

[11:50 AM] suspended reason: Because then I think you get to a cool connection with the psychology studies' failure to replicate, the way that many of soft social sciences are first and foremost a performance of objectivity and rigor ("scientism"—a noted pet peeve of Tamler's!)

[11:51 AM] suspended reason: As long as evaluation takes place on the appearance of a thing, rather than its actual/holistic state, resources get dragged into cosmetics

[11:52 AM] suspended reason: We're way less removed from honor cultures than we're usually cast as: preserving one's reputation is still the main thing, always has been (there are good [[game theory|game-theoretic]] reasons for this in any cooperative scheme, i.e. society), and it's weird this isn't more foundational in psych

[11:53 AM] suspended reason: Maybe I'm ignorant on the lit here and someone can correct me
