[6:24 PM] snav: the lineage here is that authenticity is a game we play -- but it's a super broad game whose norms inflect most domains of life (except... business, sort of) 
[6:25 PM] snav: so think of the "griefer" in video games -- he's not breaking the rules of the game, explicitly, but he's breaking the "deeper" meta rule
[6:25 PM] snav: hell, maybe I need to write this essay
[6:25 PM] snav: defending you
[6:25 PM] snav: lmao
[6:26 PM] suspended reason: Yeah
[6:27 PM] snav: there is a very clear relation here to the base lacanian frame, where sociopathy is "perversion" at the structural level
[6:27 PM] snav: i could build out an argument pretty clearly
[6:27 PM] snav: welp, now i have a fun plan for the evening hehehe
[6:27 PM] suspended reason: Right, authenticity is a performance, but what kind of thing is it performing
[6:27 PM] suspended reason: What is the signal it is trying to send
[6:28 PM] suspended reason: omg please
[6:28 PM] suspended reason: you could give some good background on the Freudian view too, that Rorty gestures at
[6:40 PM] snav: my argument will start shallow, go deep, and then dig back out:
- start shallowest -- your statement of communication is manipulation (do you have a piece i can link where you put it forward?) + how it evokes a sense of discomfort for "reasons"
- what are these reasons? "manipulation" at the social level "is wrong". what's the problem? sociopathy springs to mind.
- what is sociopathy? knowing the "rules" but refusing to abide by them. what are the rules?
  - rule 1: authenticity, the "metagame" springing from Cartesian idea of selfhood (if everyone is epistemically individual, then "it is good" to share my desire/to share what i know, because then the other can partake in what i am)
  - rule 2: Kantian respect for the other as subject as means and not ends, in the sense that they are equally Cartesian as I am (i.e. i can't "know" them in the total way that i can "know" a piece of clay, and thus make it malleable).
- reach theoretical bottom: sociopathy is a perverse stance (i know the rules, i know about authenticity... but they don't apply to me, he he)
- one form of "bad" manipulation, then, is e.g. griefing: manipulating the rules in order to get what you want, rather than abiding by the rules, in order to get what you want
- the other form of "bad" manipulation is "psychic domination", what Aella called "frame control", where you treat the other as object and use them as an end
- to reach the correct usage of "communication is manipulation", we need to move beyond the cartesian frame, and say "communication is manipulation of the shared communicative space", the system formed by the two of us in communicative action. put better, all communication is manipulation, of the vibe 
[6:41 PM] snav: i might be able to combine rule 1 into rule 2

All Communication Is Manipulation
All communication is manipulation. Some manipulation is mutually advantageous. Alternatively phrased, the purpose of communication, broadly, is the alteration of others’ actions. Or, Communic…

[6:42 PM] suspended reason: that's the best piece to backlink probably
[6:42 PM] suspended reason: interesting definition of sociopathy
[6:42 PM] snav: that's the part where i can drop in the Lacan
[6:43 PM] snav: bc that's his "perversion"
[6:43 PM] suspended reason: Part of sociopathy also seems to be whether you're on the offensive or defensive, yeah?
[6:43 PM] snav: subtext is that following the rules immanently is "neurotic"
[6:43 PM] suspended reason: No one would call you a sociopath for being inauthentic to an oppressive regime
[6:43 PM] snav: so the question is "how can we be properly neurotic and still accept this framing" lol
[6:43 PM] snav: but you can't interface directly with "a regime" (the "hegemony") -- only with specific others
[6:43 PM] suspended reason: wym following the rules immanently
[6:44 PM] snav: in the sense that the rules aren't known as such but are followed "as if" they're binding facts of reality
[6:44 PM] snav: i.e. you have no choice
[6:44 PM] snav: to have to stop and think "i know this is the rule, but am i gonna follow it?" is sociopathic
[6:44 PM] suspended reason: ahhh
[6:44 PM] suspended reason: yeah I see wym
[6:44 PM] snav: this is actually why i think autism veers into sociopathy so easily
[6:45 PM] snav: the idea of the autist "modeling" the rules means they have a choice
[6:45 PM] snav: what this does is alienate them from normal "neurotics" who have no choice, and who partly resent them for having one, and also hate them for breaking the rules
[6:46 PM] snav: this is i think why i got so much hate on my main character day last week, because i was swarmed by neurotics who saw what the person i quote tweeted did ("crying turns me off") as against "the rules"
[6:47 PM] snav: and tbf i am a neurotic too, but the thrust of my "program" has been to turn the low-level rules into higher-level rules
[6:48 PM] snav: "it's okay to break this specific rule that i know some people think is a rule, if i'm still following the higher-level rule" -- and this set of higher level rules is condensed as "the good" or "virtue", which is why i call myself a virtue ethicist 
[6:48 PM] suspended reason: wait so in this frame normies are neurotics and aspies aren't
[6:48 PM] suspended reason: heh
[6:48 PM] snav: yes
[6:48 PM] snav: lmao
[6:49 PM] snav: the original autism definition placed them as schizophrenics! but that said i still think autists are often neurotics, but they have a different set of rules than normies, so the two don't get along. part of my journey away from being "aspie like" was learning the "normal" rules intuitively
[6:50 PM] snav: there's a subset of autists who don't do this, or who do it consciously rather than intuitively, and those are the sociopaths
[6:50 PM] snav: i think this is why many people are generally wary of rationalists, esp high-up ones
[6:50 PM] snav: to the "normie", it reeks of sociopathy
[6:51 PM] snav: this is interestingly related to what Charles Taylor said was one of the main reasons behind the Protestant Reformation, which was that people got mad about priests/monks/etc having a "higher level of spirituality", and thus having permission to act differently -- they wanted everyone to be on the same plane, and make "normal" the main spiritual good
[6:52 PM] snav: this persists today in egalitarian framings
[6:52 PM] snav: utilitarianism subtly uses this in abstracting across "human life" as if it were a single thing, equal for everyone
[6:53 PM] snav: whereas an "oldschool spiritual utilitarianism" (which never really existed, because the original idea of utilitarianism grew out of egalitarian humanism) couldn't treat all people as equal in terms of preference/suffering, because certain people are more spiritually attuned and thus are deserving of a different status in terms of resource allocation 
[6:53 PM] snav: say this and people will eat you alive
[6:56 PM] snav: unrelated but know that i'm going to have to retcon your piece, and push back against the "manipulation of others' actions"
[6:56 PM] snav: because i think this is not something we really do
[6:57 PM] snav: i'm going to side with the phenomenologists in saying that we have a separate object of intersubjective space, and that is what we're manipulating, insofar as we can manipulate the vibe toward what we want
[6:57 PM] snav: and i'm going to justify this in my argument
[7:00 PM] suspended reason: You're welcome to, but I think you're mostly wrong lol
[7:00 PM] suspended reason: I think most of our communication pans out in altered behavior
[7:00 PM] suspended reason: Sometimes it can be downstream at a scale of weeks or months
[7:00 PM] suspended reason: But we do it for that downstream
[7:00 PM] snav: but if i e.g. want to hurt you, that's not me trying to make you do a specific action, that's me trying to affect your subjectivity in some way
[7:01 PM] snav: it's subject-manipulation and not behavior-manipulation
[7:01 PM] suspended reason: I think there are cases of "affective manipulation" that isn't at all outcome oriented but it's on the margin rather than vice-versa
[7:01 PM] suspended reason: Yeah that might be one of the cases on the margin
[7:01 PM] snav: i think most manipulation is affect manipulation, and that behavioral manipulation is rare outside of specific contexts
[7:01 PM] suspended reason: But I don't think it's typically what we mean by "communication"
[7:02 PM] suspended reason: Also I think hurting people is typically done to punish some behavior
[7:02 PM] suspended reason: And the purpose of punishment tends to be so that they don't do it again
[7:02 PM] suspended reason: I think you're wrong lol!
[7:03 PM] suspended reason: The very simplest level is, if I say your name, it's to get your attention (Behavioral alteration)
[7:03 PM] suspended reason: if I ask you a question, it's so you answer it (behavioral alteration)
[7:03 PM] snav: then what do you say next?
[7:03 PM] plover: this seems like a strong claim that I'd want to see supported
[7:03 PM] suspended reason: If I yell at you, it's so you stop what you're doing that made me yell at you
[7:03 PM] suspended reason: Or, alternatively, "don't tread on me" warnings
[7:03 PM] plover: when I have hurt people it's been through ignorance or misunderstanding
[7:03 PM] snav: that's not why i would yell -- i would yell because i felt overcome by emotion
[7:03 PM] suspended reason: Sure but that's not on purpose I'd imagine
[7:04 PM] plover: yeah I don't really have a lot of examples of me hurting people on purpose
[7:04 PM] suspended reason: "because" — the emotion may be the surface cause, but ostensibly it's mediating
[7:04 PM] snav: if we're reading an "in order to" into my actions here, it's only through a hermeneutic lens that stands far outside of any individual's knowledge
[7:04 PM] plover: but there's still surely a non-zero amount of me hurting people in the world, some of which I'm aware of, some of which I'm probably not
[7:04 PM] suspended reason: I think we're gonna have to silo "all the possible effects my actions can have" from "the reason why I act"
[7:04 PM] suspended reason: those are very different things
[7:05 PM] plover: anyway I don't meant to distract from the main point; I just think "hurting is done to punish" is ... a really bold claim that needs further support
[7:05 PM] suspended reason: People's actions have infinite number of effects. People act for a narrow set of reasons, which can typically be reduced to "because it achieves something they want"
[7:05 PM] snav: usually i want to hurt someone because they pissed me off and i want to "balance the scales"
[7:05 PM] snav: but "balancing the scales" isn't material -- i could do that just as easily by jabbing an effigy
[7:05 PM] snav: no behavioral impact, but it satisfies me anyway
[7:06 PM] suspended reason: Sure
[7:06 PM] suspended reason: Balance the scales feels to me like asserting power
[7:06 PM] suspended reason: It feels to me like "don't tread on me"
[7:06 PM] snav: but there's no behavioral goal here!
[7:06 PM] suspended reason: There is
[7:06 PM] snav: it's just me and my own desires
[7:06 PM] suspended reason: Wrong
[7:06 PM] suspended reason: False
[7:06 PM] suspended reason: Fake news
[7:07 PM] snav: this is a key point of Lacanianism, where he says "a love letter always reaches its destination"
[7:07 PM] snav: i think people do a lot of self-manipulation, far more than other-manipulation
[7:07 PM] suspended reason: I think it's rare we care about people's affective state in contexts totally removed from material consequences
[7:07 PM] suspended reason: We care more about people's impressions of us if their actions have stronger effects on our own situation
[7:07 PM] snav: i feel like this is most of what i do lmao, i almost never care about the material consequences but i'm very sensitive to others' affects
[7:07 PM] suspended reason: And less if they have weaker effects
[7:08 PM] suspended reason: That may well be but my purposes this is surrogation or wireheading—they're optimizing the feeling instead of altering the world
[7:08 PM] suspended reason: They're "doing it wrong"—which could be "right" in our own value hierarchy, but from an evolutionary perspective it's wireheading
[7:09 PM] snav: if i have to argue in this frame, i'd say that most people are wireheading almost all of the time, and almost never want to explicitly bring about anything other than the maintenance of a status quo
[7:09 PM] suspended reason: Gimme a thirty minute video of a construction crew working on building a house
[7:09 PM] snav: where status quo is dominated by their own feeling and not the actions of others
[7:10 PM] suspended reason: Almost everything they say is gonna be behavioral manipulation
[7:10 PM] snav: that is an exceptional case
[7:10 PM] suspended reason: Ditto with people running a ship
[7:10 PM] suspended reason: No
[7:10 PM] suspended reason: it's not!
[7:10 PM] snav: i'm thinking purely about casual sociality
[7:10 PM] snav: and not group oriented action
[7:10 PM] suspended reason: Humans performing group activities is the central example of communication
[7:10 PM] suspended reason: Casual sociality is a weird thing
[7:10 PM] snav: but it's also the least interesting and least relevant to most people
[7:10 PM] snav: casual sociality is the mystery
[7:10 PM] suspended reason: Maybe to you!
[7:10 PM] suspended reason: Oh jeez
[7:10 PM] suspended reason: I've already ceded that, an hour ago!
[7:10 PM] suspended reason: But "communication" is more prototypically a thing people do in group activity
[7:11 PM] suspended reason: How sociality gets built on top of communication is a mystery, yes
[7:11 PM] suspended reason: It's complex and weird and hazy
[7:11 PM] suspended reason: But come on, when people say communication they mean communicating information
[7:11 PM] snav: that's what i've been trying to explain this whole time -- how to reconcile "communication is manipulation" with casual sociality
[7:11 PM] suspended reason: Not shooting the shit, hanging out
[7:11 PM] snav: no!!! they mean chatting!
[7:11 PM] snav: me phone calling my mom is a prototypical communicative act
[7:12 PM] suspended reason: "Controlling behavioral responses to maintain status quo" is still behavioral manipulation
[7:12 PM] snav: my communications on the job are like a weird side space with different rules
[7:12 PM] snav: i agree with this, and this is also sort of the point of Theory of a Young Girl
[7:12 PM] snav: but it's purely negative
[7:12 PM] snav: in the sense of "don't do that" not "do that"
[7:12 PM] suspended reason: Phones didn't even exist til a hundred years ago lol
[7:12 PM] Natural Hazard: Bet this video is gonna have lots of very honest communication and very little torque :)
[7:13 PM] snav: me riding horseback to my parents' place to say hello
[7:13 PM] snav: regardless of whether we agree on this, i think it's like supremely important context that somehow never got communicated
[7:13 PM] suspended reason: yeah
[7:14 PM] suspended reason: OK, fine, so let's say you call your mom on the phone and your goals are to make her feel good and keep your relationship warm
[7:14 PM] snav: (and in this usage of communication, it's based on knowledge, because you're trying to communicate a specific reading, which isn't really a behavior so much as an act of understanding)
[7:14 PM] suspended reason: I'd argue a big reason we want to keep relationships warm is because downstream, it'll alter how they behave around us
[7:14 PM] snav: (the ways it "cashes out" behaviorally are almost entirely unknown to you, except vaguely in terms of positive regard) 
[7:14 PM] suspended reason: The problem here is that almost any positive affective change you create is gonna be followed by positive behavioral changes
[7:14 PM] snav: sure but the changes are not knowable
[7:15 PM] suspended reason: So separating what is "for" what level of the causal chain is almost impossible
[7:15 PM] plover: I get 'accused*" of being exceptionally credulous, straightforward, and non-torquey in conversation on a somewhat regular basis; and when I'm like "why though?" the response is "probably because your job is PvE instead of PvP"  (* not in a bad way, I just don't know how else to say it()
[7:15 PM] suspended reason: But from an evolutionary perspective, both natural selection and the daily training mechanism of real consequences that we call socialization/learning, real effects and consequences are prioritized
[7:15 PM] snav: from this framing, i would call affect a storehouse of indeterminate and oriented behavior
[7:15 PM] suspended reason: So to me, the real outcomes are the real incentive structure is the real driver of behavior
[7:15 PM] suspended reason: Not the mental state, which we can never know except through people's representation of it
[7:16 PM] snav: right, whereas i believe that experience is "more real" than the ultimate physical outcomes
[7:16 PM] snav: and this is a fundamental ontological division
[7:16 PM] snav: (cf. that Tamaki piece i linked Gil the other day)
[7:17 PM] snav: mainly because i think that the notion of "what is real?" is itself only possible through experiencing or through belief/knowledge which exists at the level of the "experiencer"
[7:17 PM] suspended reason: Yeah I have a whole section about this in Surrogation book, it's a common engineer vs. sociopath thing that's been remarked upon since the 1950s in game theory actually lol
[7:17 PM] snav: but this is also a fundamental divide that's been going on for several hundred years lol, Taylor talks about it at length
[7:18 PM] suspended reason: To me, what is "real" is anything that exerts itself on reality
[7:18 PM] suspended reason: Actions and behavior do alter the original speaker's reality
[7:18 PM] suspended reason: The mental state of the listener doesn't
[7:18 PM] suspended reason: Except indirectly
[7:18 PM] suspended reason: As it produces actions and behaviors
[7:18 PM] suspended reason: Including tears and smiles
[7:18 PM] snav: i think there is no singular "reality", or that material reality is effective subordinate, because the territory is inaccessible in-itself
[7:18 PM] suspended reason: I'm not arguing about metaphysics, I'm saying what matters in a training or learning system
[7:19 PM] suspended reason: And that's behavior only
[7:19 PM] snav: but the description of life as a training or learning system is metaphysics
[7:19 PM] suspended reason: We just can't know what another person experiences
[7:19 PM] suspended reason: So we can't even try to optimize for it other than through surrogates
[7:19 PM] suspended reason: Which is behavior
[7:19 PM] suspended reason: And when we're rewarded and punished in life for the shit we say or express, it's via behavioral changes in the people around us
[7:20 PM] snav: that's true, but there's a layer of buffering between the behavioral changes and our personalized interpretation of those changes
[7:20 PM] snav: so, IMO, to prioritize the behavioral and not the interpretive layer is to miss the "true" meaning of the material domain
[7:21 PM] snav: in that one and the same action can seem very different to me depending on what affect i bring to the table as interpreter 
[7:23 PM] suspended reason: IDK how to resolve this tbh
[7:23 PM] snav: typically your method of resolution is to invoke an "objective interpretation" via evolutionary theory
[7:24 PM] suspended reason: If you're set on casual sociality as the prototypal communication realm, and you're not happy with "When a question is asked, it's to get an answer" type levels of behavioral manipulation, then I def can't argue that casual sociality is a realm where immediate effects are prioritized
[7:24 PM] suspended reason: Perhaps more interesting or productive than saying "Is communication more in service of manipulating behavior or affective state"  is saying, "Clearly, behavioral manipulation is name of the game in group activity and coordination and warfare/conflict situations, but in casual sociality it isn't—what's up with that?"
[7:25 PM] snav: yes, i completely agree!
[7:25 PM] snav: and i think if you did that -- people wouldn't be as mad. lol
[7:25 PM] snav: if we bound the domain to coordinative activity then i have no objections to your reasoning
[7:26 PM] snav: we would also need to bracket out the casual workplace conversation that isn't related to the task at hand (e.g. our group chat w Zak)
[7:26 PM] suspended reason: yeah
[7:27 PM] suspended reason: OK so my task this week will be figuring out what is special about casual sociality
[7:27 PM] suspended reason: So that I can eventually write an essay that makes this distinction and is able to offer a coherent explanation of the differences
[7:27 PM] snav: i very much look forward to this
[7:28 PM] suspended reason: this was good, very productive, many things were discovered
[7:29 PM] plover: when will you publish your surrogation book
[7:33 PM] suspended reason: are you saying here that we are arguably Actually Optimizing for our interpretation of behavior?
[7:33 PM] suspended reason: I like it
[7:33 PM] snav: i still may write this btw, but noting the context here and not as an explicit defense but rather as a different angle entirely, oriented toward diff ends
[7:33 PM] snav: i think that's fair to say
[7:34 PM] snav: it was more of an epistemological point though
[7:34 PM] snav: but that is indeed one conclusion
[7:35 PM] suspended reason: Yeah I mean pretty much anything you ended up writing about it I'd be stoked on
[7:35 PM] suspended reason: It doesn't have to be supportive, I just want to continue processing the idea and its limitations and its affordances
[7:35 PM] suspended reason: to recap a few,
1. the way "manipulation" here (tennis example) is a third-party functional description of behavior a la ethology 
2. the nature of casual sociality as apparently non-behavioral, in contrast to clear cases of group coordination and inter-agent conflict
3. self-manipulation as one purpose of epistemological action, and its potential to be called 'wireheading' from a certain perspective, and to be called healthy emotional regulation from another
4. the problem of affective states only being available through behavioral surrogates, and how we ought to separate behavioral manipulation from affective manipulation, given it does seem there is a meaningful distinction to make here
5. that most affective changes result in behavioral changes, leading to a problem in determining what the "purpose" of the stimulus was
[7:36 PM] snav: i will probably drop one backlink and then head my own direction rather than quoting you / dialoguing
