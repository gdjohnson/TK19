12:43 PM] snav: thinking that "all communication is motivated" might be better than "all communication is manipulation"
[1:14 PM] suspended reason: The central idea that's being conveyed with manipulation is this: the alteration of the receiver's behavior through strategic representation of reality
[1:15 PM] suspended reason: So if I use a question mark and phrase something using sentence conventions, what I'm doing is representing that I am making an inquiry or am curious about a certain subject, and I represent this way—strategically, using conventions—in order to hopefully provoke a response from you, e.g. "Do you think motivation really covers this kind of alteration of receiver behavior?"
[1:17 PM] snav: the part i still struggle with is that "manipulation" usually implies a specific desired outcome rather than the case we discussed the other day of an "I'll just see what happens"
[1:19 PM] suspended reason: Yeah, I def agree that the connotations are there, but I just don't have another word that's more flexible but equally implies alteration of someone's behavior—which I maybe think of as a question of how narrow or pre-specified the manipulated response is, insofar as I think we always have in mind a semi-specific set of "types of responses" we're hoping for
[1:19 PM] suspended reason: "I hope they honestly tell me their feelings" is still a pretty narrow response pattern
[1:20 PM] suspended reason: Even if there's a huge amount of degrees of freedom in the kind of response you get—it'd be weird and frustrating if they started telling you about Teletubbies or what their dog ate for breakfast
[1:21 PM] suspended reason: I think the frustration we'd have with, like, the vast majority of linguistically possible responses, even when we're communicating in a super "open-ended" way, reveals that "open-endedness" is relative to a pretty (absolute-scoped) narrow set of desired/expected responses
[1:22 PM] snav: hmmmm
[1:23 PM] suspended reason: 😄
[1:24 PM] beiser: I feel like "manipulation" puts the sin on the ends, where the real gripe people have is usually the means.
[1:28 PM] beiser: the thing that makes it manipulation is usually some sort of dishonesty, either explicit or implicit, but beyond the pale of what would have been expected by the receiver
[1:32 PM] suspended reason: Yes, I mean, this is how we use the social sense of "manipulation"—the tool/manual sense of manipulating an object is totally value neutral, and that's really the sense I wanna call upon
[1:32 PM] suspended reason: We have this paradoxical/simultaneous aversion to/terror of being manipulated, even as our entire social existence is a process of mutual manipulating
[1:33 PM] suspended reason: And you're 100% right that the difference is the dishonest kind, where there's a hidden agenda (sometimes bad for us, sometimes good—see e.g. Moms trying to manipulate their kids for their own sake, and how much it pisses them off)
[1:33 PM] suspended reason: So that to some extent the receiver can't actively "opt in" to participating in the manipulation b/c they don't actually understand the terms of the agreement they're signing 
[1:34 PM] beiser: I don't think it's about the agenda at all—everyone has a hidden agenda, it only looks objectionable when it doesn't concord with their behavior.
[1:34 PM] suspended reason: (We see something similar in art, right? Where obviously whenever a movie makes you laugh or cry, you're being manipulated. But it's the sort of artless, dishonest manipulation that pisses us off, we "see though it" etc)
[1:35 PM] suspended reason: What do you think it's about? B/c to me the discord between "performed agenda" and "actual agenda" is the root of the dishonesty
[1:36 PM] suspended reason: BTW great Goffman quote that's relevant here:
> And so we find that clergymen give the impression that they entered the church because of a call of felt vocation, in America tending to conceal their interest in moving up socially, in Britain tending to conceal their interest in not moving too far down.

[1:36 PM] beiser: That's the implicit case. Some people will just lie to you though.
[1:44 PM] beiser: Here's a case that's an extreme example—Redditor's roommate tells all of her coworkers about how OP is abusive, then when they all get dinner together, she says something that they interpret as out of line and begin absolutely hounding OP for her shit. The problem is that the entire thing is a scam, and simply comparing notes is enough to make the whole thing fall apart. https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/qn9jr6/woman_is_blindsided_when_her_friends_colleagues/
[1:49 PM] beiser: this is the paradigmatic case to me, not the lesser forms that are about representation of one's emotional state
[1:54 PM] snav: this post is really good
[1:56 PM] snav: that third to last paragraph which reveals the deep motivation, god DAMN
[2:02 PM] suspended reason: Insane post
[2:03 PM] suspended reason: It just get mentioned as a brief aside but—they work in the art world
[2:03 PM] beiser: that the first post is on "AITA" and the comments are evenly split is pretty fascinating
[2:04 PM] beiser: i don't think it's actually that unusual though, it's just that most people aren't dumb enough to invite everyone to a party together
[2:04 PM] suspended reason: Definitely not "manipulation that's mutually beneficial" 😆 . I guess there's a question to be asked about whether dishonesty or consequences are more important
[2:04 PM] suspended reason: Yeah
[2:05 PM] suspended reason: Some version of "multiple faces for multiple audiences" seems like something naturally incentivized once you break out of the village/tribe structure
[2:05 PM] suspended reason: And people naturally exist in different, only somewhat overlapping subcultures (work, hobby, uni friends, online friends, etc)
[2:08 PM] suspended reason: GTG learn some Solidity, got distracted by this, but will check in later

[5:12 pm] suspended reason:
> These are all attempts to control your frame, but none of these is what I mean by frame control. These techniques can be manipulative or abusive, but they’re also broadcast clearly; in a similar way to how a man catcalling on a busy street alerts both the target and everyone else to their presence. It’s annoying, but clearly legible. It’s easy for you and everyone around you to say to each other, “Ah, that person wants something from you” and move on with your day.
> No; frame control is the “man doesn’t announce his presence, he just stalks you silently” of the communication world. It’s when you end up in the other person’s box without knowing that it happened. It’s not violence you can feel, or coaxing you can reason with; it’s a slow build of their frame around you until you don’t remember what your box ever looked like. Frame control is a quiet subversion of your agency; instead of offering up their frame for you to consider, they pull you in without consent, into a world you probably would never have endorsed from the outside.

This seems like exactly the distinction that @beiser and I were batting around re: "bad manipulation" vs manipulation we're ok with and don't call manipulation
