[1:30 PM] Albertus_Krungus: @beiser so why have you gathered these good people
[1:30 PM] Albertus_Krungus: i don't have any more kidneys to donate
[1:30 PM] suspended reason: I'm chugging a Nos Cmplx6
[1:30 PM] Albertus_Krungus: abusing drugs as usual
[1:30 PM] suspended reason:

[1:30 PM] suspended reason: That's the occasion
[1:30 PM] suspended reason: Beiser convened the good people to entertain me while I'm highly caffeinated
[1:30 PM] suspended reason: Ready go
[1:31 PM] Albertus_Krungus: that's cool that you can still perceive the effects of caffeine
[1:31 PM] Albertus_Krungus: what with the damage you've done to yourself
[1:31 PM] suspended reason: Also Beiser wants everyone to hear the good news about my transition into crypto party reporter cum Web3 philosopher
[1:31 PM] suspended reason: It's an exciting new direction—not for myself, I mean; for the culture
[1:32 PM] Albertus_Krungus: i thought you came to the conclusion that you don't care about those things
[1:32 PM] Albertus_Krungus: or, at least, not as much as other things
[1:32 PM] suspended reason: You'd be surprised I've always been one for diversity of chems, I don't actually take very much or binge very often so my receptors are ostensibly in fantastic shape
[1:33 PM] suspended reason: Antifragile but not depleted.
[1:33 PM] suspended reason: I have takes about how institutions and interpersonal interaction work, and Web3 has a void of coherent thinkers, so I think it's a solid grift
[1:34 PM] Albertus_Krungus: haha
Yay you made it,

FalseProphet
 just showed up!
 — Today at 3:46 PM
[3:50 PM] FalseProphet: went to a few last two weeks
[3:50 PM] FalseProphet: only one conclusion -- calling top on crypto
[3:50 PM] snav: i assume u were at OpenSea then
[3:51 PM] FalseProphet: was worse than the florida scene in the big short
[3:52 PM] FalseProphet: met up with a girl from Canada who is a freshman at Waterloo -- she and a group of literal high-schoolers (30 in all) were flown to NYC by this guy Ric Burton
[3:52 PM] FalseProphet: basically all of them underage girls
[3:52 PM] FalseProphet: at one point in the weekend so many random promoters are begging them to come to this party or that to improve the (dismal) gender ratio
[3:52 PM] FalseProphet: they get offered a $1,000 bar tab at a club
[3:52 PM] FalseProphet: again, underage
[3:53 PM] FalseProphet: and the guy Ric Burton sets up the whole thing to have groupies basically
[3:53 PM] FalseProphet: discount Jeffrey Epstein shit
[3:53 PM] snav: yeah our 18yo intern was also going to a bunch of NYC events
[3:53 PM] snav: this all makes sense
[3:54 PM] snav: the "party" modality is what's so weird about it. can't they just be networking events
[3:59 PM] FalseProphet: saw a little bit of both but there was definitely a "sweet release" / baccanal side to the whole thing
[3:59 PM] FalseProphet: my theory is a lot of insular nerds who accidentally became millionaires during the pandemic but because of restrictions have not really had a chance to experience the social phenomenon of being new money to such an extent
[4:00 PM] FalseProphet: and haven't been among "their people" in such numbers at once
[4:15 PM] snav: Tracks w my experience
[4:24 PM] suspended reason: JFC
[4:25 PM] suspended reason: I saw a little bit of this in Lisbon and thought it was gross, but that's another level
[4:26 PM] suspended reason: what's that Tiqqun line—"The Young Girl is the most valuable of all traded & perishable commodities" or something
[4:27 PM] suspended reason: I was reading a Kaitlin Phillips party report from 2015 this morning and she runs into a college undergrad at a Purple Mag party, the young girl says (about her hosts/fellow attendees)—"I think they'd snort me if they could"
[4:28 PM] suspended reason: My cultural forecast is that in 2022/23 the femcels get a lot more cultural voice/power and they start speaking out against sexual capital and it becomes part of the culture war. I've seen the lolcow femcel boards—they're beginning to develop class consciousness, no question
[4:48 PM] beiser: do you really think that it’ll just sink into the culture war? they feel like a force well outside the existing coalitions to me
[4:57 PM] similaralterity: I've said this before and I'll say it again: crypto is Gunna be part of some insane Iran Contra type of story sometime in the future 
[4:57 PM] FalseProphet: the future?
[4:58 PM] FalseProphet: we’re here now haha
[4:58 PM] FalseProphet: First as tragedy (Epstein), now as farce (NFT freak)
[4:58 PM] similaralterity: Yes but few people understand how fucking spooky and huge someone like Brock Pierce's influence is on the whole space
[4:59 PM] similaralterity: not pretending like i know, but shit stinks, something is off in decentraland...per se lol 
[4:59 PM] similaralterity: Anyhow that's an insane story
[5:00 PM] similaralterity: Apropos i just saw this meme/post today

Twitter•Yesterday at 3:51 PM
[5:09 PM] suspended reason: I think they are rn, but that's exactly how it works—as Paglia says, Euripides' Bacchae is fundamentally a story about an alien whose otherness disrupts the careful, Apollonian symbolic architecture of Thebes
[5:10 PM] suspended reason: This is what culture is IMO—aliens that don't fit into the symbolic order disrupting it, and forcing the symbolic order to re-order itself around them
[5:11 PM] suspended reason: she's incredibly pretty lmao
[5:12 PM] suspended reason: omg the video's first minute: "as an objective 3/10 I have some right to talk on this issue"
[5:13 PM] suspended reason: sounds like someone gaslit her
[5:13 PM] suspended reason: poor girl
[5:14 PM] similaralterity: The internet imo, I'm sure she convinced herself, i doubt she was directly gaslit
[5:14 PM] similaralterity: basically true of most -cel culture
[5:14 PM] similaralterity: Imo
[5:15 PM] FalseProphet: No Truecels under Heaven
[5:15 PM] FalseProphet: What no Mandate of Heaven does to an mf
[5:15 PM] suspended reason: Yeah she does say tho "females can be brutally honest about [my looks], some are cruel, I've started to meet some nicer females at my school, I like to call them my friends, they're the closest thing I've ever had to friends in my whole life, even though I don't talk to them I listen in... the females at my old school were very open about how ugly I was, and would do horrible things"
[5:15 PM] suspended reason: Also, side note that she keeps saying FEMALES lmfao
[5:16 PM] FalseProphet: Christ I’m gonna get retraumatized thinking about Tiqqun again especially as I have to continue going to these events for work
[5:18 PM] similaralterity: Ah ok ok, sorry i didn't actually seek out the video.
[5:18 PM] FalseProphet: oh did you happen to meet someone by the name of "Kash Money"?
[5:19 PM] suspended reason: lmfao no, pill me
[5:20 PM] suspended reason: I do need more juicy Lisbon/Eth conf/Web3 cultural details
[5:20 PM] Albertus_Krungus: broke: transgender
woke: transugly
[5:20 PM] suspended reason: "I identify as a 3/10"
[5:20 PM] Albertus_Krungus: i no longer feel comfortable claiming that something like that "could never happen"
[5:21 PM] FalseProphet: Iranian guy who created that comedy deepfake app and then legally changed his name from Kashmandu Nouroozi to Kash Money -- now just flies around the world doing psychadelics and attending Web3 conferences with his multi-million IP buyout
[5:21 PM] Albertus_Krungus: nothing looks as good as ugly feels
[5:25 PM] suspended reason: amazing.
[5:25 PM] suspended reason: I can't even imagine going from Iran to the international psychedelic & web3 party circuit
[5:26 PM] suspended reason: what an insane life course
[5:26 PM] FalseProphet: on rising femcel phenomenon (and maybe internet-poisoning more generally) was splitting an uber Friday night with two girls and a trad-catholic incel friend of mine who is completely incapable of keeping his mouth shut about anything. he's having a relatively normal conversation with one of them about Kierkegaard and then mentions "the WQ" -- the girl he's talking to is somewhat dumbfounded and starts interrogating to figure out what it is, the girl in the back instantly recognizes it and then blurts it out and then the three of us make eye contact -- more and more people these days...
[5:26 PM] similaralterity: cel chic
[5:29 PM] similaralterity: Wq?...is it what i think it is
[5:29 PM] FalseProphet: if you know you're ngmi
[5:30 PM] suspended reason: thank god, I'm gonna make it
[5:30 PM] FalseProphet: funniest part is he texts me after he gets out of the car "that was the first serious multi-sentence conversation I've had with a female in over a year and a half"
[5:30 PM] snav: i don't know it either so gmi
[5:31 PM] Albertus_Krungus: every day i thank the gods i'm not young right now 
[5:32 PM] similaralterity: how old
[5:32 PM] FalseProphet: 25?
[5:32 PM] similaralterity: Same. Someone pin this
[5:33 PM] FalseProphet: every day I come to comprehend deeper just how much worse its about to get
[5:34 PM] Albertus_Krungus: in what ways?
[5:34 PM] FalseProphet: being young right now very dissociative experience, especially being unfortunate enough to have had unfettered near-constant internet access since the age of 5-6
[5:34 PM] Albertus_Krungus: "digital native" as curse
[5:35 PM] suspended reason: read this vibe shift short story lol https://arena-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/13951049/ca80645c00644f939668da693d7cfa4e.pdf?1636726998
[5:36 PM] FalseProphet: peer effects most powerful force in socialization -> avg. American teen socialized primarily by the internet now -> last two years universalized the poisoning effects of hermetically sealed Gen Z culture -> its so much worse than you know
[5:36 PM] suspended reason: (it's very short, 5min read & you get the idea by 2min in)
[5:36 PM] FalseProphet: think about the 1990s -- average american family did 8 hours of TV watching per day
[5:36 PM] FalseProphet: today -- per Nielsen survey from last year, average American youth 16-24 uses TikTok 3-4 hours a day
[5:37 PM] Albertus_Krungus: it's miasmically sickening right off the bat
[5:37 PM] FalseProphet: I think even cynical/blackpilled older people just don't understand how bad its already gotten because they aren't imbibing this shit
[5:37 PM] FalseProphet: its a living nightmare -- and also the main source of identity formation for basically all adolescents now
[5:38 PM] Albertus_Krungus: that is really sad
[5:38 PM] FalseProphet: just look at the way people dress lol, friend at Stanford says half the girls in his math TA sessions come in what appear to be slightly nicer versions of cosplay Japanese sailor schoolgirl outfits
[5:38 PM] similaralterity: TikTok imo is insane and has marginal redeeming qualities
[5:40 PM] suspended reason: how old are ya FalseProphet?
[5:41 PM] FalseProphet: I knew there were Feds in this chat
[5:41 PM] FalseProphet: My handlers aren't gonna let me answer that question
[5:41 PM] similaralterity: yeah this seems phenomenologically accurate. Portrait of a zoomer psyche
[5:41 PM] suspended reason: aight aight
[5:41 PM] snav: jesus
[5:41 PM] suspended reason: are you gen-z or millennial
[5:41 PM] FalseProphet: Kidding haha I'm 21
[5:41 PM] suspended reason: that's what I care about
[5:41 PM] suspended reason: nice
[5:42 PM] snav: also fuck i got into anime too early, too old
[5:42 PM] snav: back in my day it was NOT cool and sexy 
[5:42 PM] Albertus_Krungus: hahaha
[5:44 PM] Albertus_Krungus: i guess it's like delicious tacos for girls?
[5:44 PM] snav: becoming the fucking millennial woody allen
[5:44 PM] Albertus_Krungus: i guess i don't personally see the value of staying on that irony level long enough to write in its voice 
[5:44 PM] suspended reason: it's good at channeling and creating that feeling tho, and she toys with you—at first, it could basically be real, and the stuff about breast implants is awful, and then it gets full magical realism and you're almost relieved—"thank god that bit wasn't true"
[5:45 PM] suspended reason: And it's super good at manipulating signifiers, like I mentioned in zeitgeist
[5:45 PM] suspended reason: it's like a signifier collage
[5:45 PM] snav: it's so immediately self-aware
[5:45 PM] Albertus_Krungus: so this is what getting old feels like
[5:46 PM] Albertus_Krungus: stages of loss but for alignment with the zeitgeist
[5:46 PM] snav: it seems like it doesn't actually do anything with the signifiers other than demonstrate them. like, it felt indulgent in spite of its self-awareness
[5:46 PM] snav: or, idk
[5:47 PM] snav: maybe my standards are too high or oldschool
[5:47 PM] snav: Or maybe i should give it credit for tapping my neuroses
[5:47 PM] Albertus_Krungus: i feel like i really am running out of energy to articulate what i don't like about things
[5:48 PM] Albertus_Krungus: it just has nothing to do with me and my opinion is absolutely irrelevant
[5:49 PM] snav: im gonna articulate what i don't like by being honest to the point of embarrassment: it felt like it was written by a hot early-mid 20s NYU grad, who i resent because i desire her
[5:49 PM] snav: (and she knows it)
[5:49 PM] Albertus_Krungus: and yet, she probably isn't benefitting from it
[5:50 PM] snav: aka why i stay the fuck away from these scenes
[5:50 PM] snav: she's benefitting by getting published/popular
[5:51 PM] Albertus_Krungus: yeah but is that really a benefit
[5:51 PM] suspended reason: Yeah, I'm not 100% sure how I feel about the "signifier bricolage" approach other than I think (1) it's probably decent/reasonable worldbuilding + "history of the present" social network documenting, (2) that it's reasonably effective at establishing a mood
[5:51 PM] suspended reason: Actually, it's interesting, Gabrinosaurus has talked before about how works have gotten "vibier" and I think there's 2 ways that's true, and they're meaningfully different
[5:52 PM] suspended reason: The way I think he meant is more ambient, like a Villeneue movie—the color of light, pacing
[5:52 PM] snav: she's getting what she (thinks/believes she) wants (not really for me to judge) 
[5:52 PM] suspended reason: But the other is a constellation of signifiers
[5:53 PM] suspended reason: yeah this is basically a feeling I identified in myself and writing El morado was a way of therapeutically processing it and getting to the other side of the tunnel & it was a surprisingly effective way to boot
[5:53 PM] Albertus_Krungus: by being nice, i will finally give graham room to wholly adopt my most unforgiving views
[5:53 PM] suspended reason: then I got spit out into the crypto scene and got hit by financial envy instead, so I guess "the work is never finished"
[5:54 PM] suspended reason: It's like how oysters respond to irritants by making pearls, except the irritant is "bad feelings" and the pearl is "my writing" (I guess)
[5:54 PM] snav: my grumpy old man sense here is that online worlds are increasingly autistic, in the sense where drama requires people to recognize each other and interact, whereas vibe is "internal" and "object-ive" rather than interpersonal, trans-subjective
[5:54 PM] suspended reason: stop deadnaming me!!
[5:55 PM] Albertus_Krungus: i don't even know if you're kidding
[5:56 PM] suspended reason: you can call me "Spendy" or "Spendo" for short if "Suspended" or "Suspended Reason" are too long
[5:56 PM] Albertus_Krungus: seriously?
[5:56 PM] snav: corollary here is that "drama" feels not so much personal or interpersonal anymore as political, pushed into a more abstract plane
[5:57 PM] Albertus_Krungus: how about Sus
[5:57 PM] suspended reason: that works
[5:57 PM] Albertus_Krungus: reez nuts
[6:01 PM] suspended reason: Update: I've been informed that Elle Sept 2021 issue discussed femcels at length
[6:01 PM] FalseProphet: relatable
[6:01 PM] suspended reason: Cultural timeline might be ahead of schedule 
[6:01 PM] FalseProphet: NYC is like hell on earth, but very fun
[6:06 PM] suspended reason: I wonder if endlessly mapping signifiers is a way of dealing with society ambiguousness
[6:07 PM] suspended reason: you know how military people talk about how anxiolytic it is to just know the protocol/hierarchy clearly/explicitly, in terms of interaction?
[6:07 PM] FalseProphet: oh yes ofc welcome to NYC
[6:07 PM] suspended reason: contemporary culture is like the opposite of the military
[6:07 PM] suspended reason: everything is fluid everyone pretends power doesn't exist
[6:07 PM] FalseProphet: make sure not to turn backwards when you leave or you'll be smited too
[6:07 PM] suspended reason: but it's ofc the autist's nightmare because the power is just as real it's just more hidden and implicit now
[6:07 PM] suspended reason: and doesn't obey clear rules
[6:07 PM] suspended reason: so you map the signifiers in order to get power over them
