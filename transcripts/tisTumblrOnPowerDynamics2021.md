**Title: What kinds of things are "power dynamics"?**

A recent discussion among some [Inexact Sciences](https://href.li/?https://theinexactsciences.github.io/) folks relates to status and power dynamics and what those words actually refer to. Forget trying to agree on when those things are activated—assume we can all tell the king has asked me to kiss the royal toes he washes but once a year and I'm leaning towards answering "yes": what _is_ that? What's "making" me do that?

Don't say "power". What's power?

"Power" is the perfect example of a word you shouldn't try to find an exact correspondence to in reality. See, we use "power" when the situation we're in has some kind of change or lack of change that we assume something must be exerting force to maintain. What's force? It's just what changes things. These things don't have exact definitions (don't tell me F=ma, that's not what people mean when they talk about force 90% of the time), because we use them at a higher level of abstraction to refer to general properties of the mental models we assume other people have. We assume other people have mostly divided up the world into discrete entities that exert potential onto each other and change the properties of each other; force is just the realization of this potential.

I won't say too much more on this use of vague language except to say: it's absolutely necessary, no matter how rigorous you're trying to be. Communication, by definition, has to start from common reference points and very often those reference points are communication tools that describe very abstract patterns—which is exactly why we can share them across diverse contexts and cultures.

Back to power dynamics—I would argue that humans inevitably see much of their lives as the application of force of various kinds. I use my "financial force" to buy groceries or to steamroll someone during poker—the former is only different in that the grocery store has so much more financial force than me I can't really bargain, but instead use a pre-defined API. Haggling situations are the obvious middle ground. I would argue for a definition of power dynamics as a term used to refer to the general system of "when I exert power, how will future exertions of power change?"

This is an extremely broad definition, but I feel that "power dynamics" describes an incredibly broad range of phenomena. Indeed—I would argue most of communication is basically focused on coordination and prodding/exploring/updating power dynamics. I also think this definition covers the most under-rated part of power dynamics: that they're mostly used so we can know what choices we have that hardly influence them.

Every time the power dynamics of a situation change, for instance in your workplace, you have to overhaul an immense amount of knowledge. The overly-simplified version of this is how people in new situations always try to sniff out "who's boss", but obviously many situations are much more complicated that, largely owing to the fact that there are many different kinds of leverage people can have over each other.

So, if we want to start studying power dynamics the way to do it would be with the null-hypothesis that the average action a person takes is meant to maintain the status quo.

This seems more or less right, but it seems like there’s a lot more to explore here, and I wanna try to expand/unpack the grocery store example a bit. Why doesn’t the grocery store have power over you? Or, rather, what kinds of power does it have?

Physically or “intrinsically” speaking, the “grocery store"—which is basically an abstraction of a superorganism that can make decisions, and coordinate action among its suborganisms—has about as much power over you as its manager can convince his employees to exercise. In theory, the grocery store has the power—with a dozen plus employees—to pin you to the floor and torture you to death. In practice, the grocery store doesn’t have anything _near_ this power, because the employees cannot be coerced to do such an act. What _can_ a manager get his employees to do? My vague preliminary answer is, "most anything legal, so long as it is financially worth the employees’ doing (if only to keep their jobs), plus some stuff that encroaches on illegality, given certain provisos.” And the question becomes: (1) what illegal things? (2) why is the boundary line anchored to legality?

We’ll start with (2), since the answer is less complicated and helps us answer the first. Legality determines the border of what the grocery store can coerce employees to do because (a) the government is more powerful, legally and physically/intrinsically, than the grocery store, (b) we have a legal system that theoretically protects the compensation of employees who are fired for refusing to partake in illegal activity, and which, additionally, is liable to punish them for _not_ refusing, for complying with law-breaking. So when a manager asks an employee to do something obviously illegal, that employee can anticipate, in theory, that a more powerful entity will overrule any negative consequences of not complying, and additionally, could impose much more serious consequences (prison, execution) _for_ complying. (Powerful in what sense? It can change the employee’s life, specifically here, in an unwanted way. But you can imagine an equally influential power born in the potential to upgrade and improve.)

Anarchist sympathizers would like to point out that even without a government, the grocery store would similarly be answerable to their community, which could either enact mob justice, or boycott the business. Here, the dynamics are slightly different than the government situation, but the general principle of anticipating consequences remains: the acts of the grocery store are bounded by risk assessment, by how legibly immoral the request is (so that it could easily stir up community anger) and the extent to which it can be proved, or at least testified to by multiple witnesses.

There is also room here, obviously, for conscience, and moral objection. But I think we can actually approximate moral objections by deferring to “What negative community consequences would come if I did this?” Not that our morals are quite _totally_ self-serving, but most violations of morality which would lead a clerk to refuse a manager’s request are also almost necessarily violations of community norms.

I think (1) is easier to answer now. The illegal things that employees can be persuaded to do are grossly those which they find morally reprehensible (the cost to their integrity outweighs the financial hit of disobeying) or that they do not believe they can prove to the government, or that they do not think could “blow back” onto them legally. And because the manager himself does not want to be held accountable for making obviously illegal requests, the space of what he would ask to begin with is radically diminished.

So the power of the “grocery store” is limited by what its employees are willing to do, and what it’s decision-making cohort is willing to ask. These are in turn limited by what other entities (government, mob, consumers) could potentially do to them, depending on their own choices and actions.

Cultural condition certainly players a role here, and I don’t believe that in some immediate conscious sense, individuals think in such a calculating way, but consider: the cultural training happens in part to _keep you out of jail_, because people who follow cultural norms effectively _do well reproductively_.)

Finally, because you, the individual customer who wonders “How much power does this institution have over me?”, participates in or supports (e.g. financially, as in taxes) these checking powers, there is a real sense in which we can say you individually work to establish a cooperative retaliatory force which limits exertion of force (unwanted, disruptive change) on any single individual.

Sidebar: I was tempted to say “reproduction-threatening” change, but I believe convicted felons have a higher birth rate than average… That’s a case of a [mesa-optimizer de-synchronized from its base optimizer](https://href.li/?https://suspendedreason.com/2021/02/02/the-surrogation-matrix/) by virtue of context change, methinks.

Coming back to power dynamic and “mutual future modeling.”

When a player “pushes over” another player in poker, what gives him the force to do so? What fact about the two players’ situation describes the source of that force? Ostensibly, the fact that the pushed-over player has significantly more to lose. One has “more armor” or “higher hitpoints,” which means that he can play iterated rounds against his opponent with (say) even odds—or even unfavorable odds—and still eliminate his opponent. Very simply, the odds are against the less powerful player, so he folds.

When a player compels an opponent to some dangerous or degrading act (like kiss a boot), what compels acquiescence? Very simply, the consequences of not acquiescing will be higher than that of acquiescing. I think there is more to the story here, a level of abstraction lower than “very simple,” but I’m not sure yet what to articulate.

When someone says they were pressured or manipulated in a situation, because their manipulator had more power, the implication is, simultaneously, that they both could and could not say no. Their free will was trespassed, or diminished, but still present. The power situation created a situation in which doing the act was still chosen (it was not _quite_ “forced,” although different discourses quibble a more dichotomous was/was not). But the pressured person would not have chosen it under different (some imagined neutral) circumstances—ostensibly, would not have chosen the action for its “intrinsic” benefits. (Benefits sans the influence of the persuader.) Rather, the (e.g. social) advantage of doing it “artificially” supplemented the intrinsic benefits, such that they outweighed the intrinsic cons (which normally would have outweighed the intrinsic benefits…)

When someone has something you want—say, the power to promote you—you end up doing things you wouldn’t otherwise (in some hypothetically “neutral” situation), for them and too them. (E.g. laughing at their jokes, complimenting them, staying late at the office.)

And like you said, this is about the power of one individual to potentially or actually alter the state, the standing, the prospects, the futures, the garden of paths, of a second individual. And this fact changing the incentive structure, more or less, of the interaction. Which is how we think of the “power” in power dynamics.

And I suppose this is why “power dynamic” doesn’t feel like a social primitive to me, in terms of fundamental explanatory power, even though it’s clearly a very salient part of social life. Rather, “power dynamic” feels like an abstract pattern in a relationship regarding asymmetric amounts of control by interaction members over one another’s futures.

This creates a specific type of incentive structure in which, crucially, the _short-term_ outcomes of each member is skewed, asymmetrically, in favor of the powerful and at the cost of the flattered (one party will be flattered, the other has to brown-nose; one party receives public status, the other ceremonially surrenders his). And this is done in the hope that the transformational force of the powerful leads to better _long-term_ outcomes for the prostrated. (Than if they had not prostrated…)

It is a gift which prays for an answering gift.

I’m going to tersely respond to the important stuff that I feel is missing from both of these. 

> [Very simply, the consequences of not acquiescing will be higher than that of acquiescing. I think there is more to the story here, a level of abstraction lower than “very simple,” but I’m not sure yet what to articulate.](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Cf2xxC3Yx9g6w7yXN/notes-from-don-t-shoot-the-dog)

How does someone determine the consequences of acquiescing? How do they compare it against the consequences of not acquiescing? What parts of they’re mind are they using? I think the answer has HUGE downstream effects. I’m going to lazily split cognitive systems into “classical conditioning” and “reason/intentional planning”.

Classical conditioning doesn’t allow for planning. A “trainer” can implement arbitrary trigger-response pairs and get something that simulates an intelligent response, but behavior born of conditioning has a limit to its flexibility (intentional planning also has limits to flexibility, those limits are just much higher than those of conditioning). Also, most “teaching” is conditioning. Also, since [punishment](https://href.li/?https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/E4zGWYzh6ZiG85b2z/the-curse-of-the-counterfactual) [doesn’t](https://href.li/?https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Cf2xxC3Yx9g6w7yXN/notes-from-don-t-shoot-the-dog) work, most “teaching” is conditioning people to cheat on tests. 

One difference that makes a difference is time-scale. On what time scale does the powerful party expect their demands to be met? In various families, schools, and prisons, the expected time scale for obedience is **immediately**. For every parent that said “TRADE OFFER: you apologize, and you don’t get a timeout. This deal has a 1 day expiration date, contact my people when you’ve made your decision” there was another that slapped their kid if they didn’t apologize the second after they demanded an apology.

Immediate obedience [isn’t real, it’s not even possible](https://twitter.com/s_r_constantin/status/1224772428611473408?s=20). Yet, it’s often demanded. This almost necessitates that any behaviors you learn in response to this kinda power (power that leans towards demanding rapid obediance) will be the **conditioned kind** (not conditioned as in your blank slate programmed, because remember, punishment is a robustly doesn’t align incentives. Conditioned in the sense of trigger-response reflexes, guided by evolutionary fit) and won’t be behavior that flows from reason/planning/intelligence. There simply isn’t time to think. No time to plan. Any ingenuity in one’s response to power will stem from iterative/evolutionary processes.

Why do I think this matters?

I care because:

1. Conditioned behavior is harder to change than reasoned behavior.

2. Maladaptiveness: while there are plenty of structures I’m embedded in that have plenty of power over me, these structures are vastly different from the contexts that I learned my conditioned responses to power.

3. As we’ve sorta been talking about, there’s lots of road-blocks to being able to think explicitly about power dynamics

Most people get “properly socialized” over the course of childhood, which is a context where people bigger and stronger and often smarter than you have total legal control over you, and you spend all your days in institutions that have almost total legal control over you. As a kid, there’s a ridiculous amount of very credible threats that others can make to your well being. Teachers and parents can be explicit or implicit with these threats, but you understand you can just get fucked.

Upon exiting that world, the whole landscape changes, but conditioned behavior is much slower to change. It’s just like Dr. K was talking about, you’re learning to play the game on some whack ass mod, and then you entire a new env and your skills are (potentially) maladaptive. I think one of the bigger parts of “becoming an adult” is really internalizing the degree to which it is so much harder for people to hurt you.

I see many ways in which the lives of people I care about are made worse because of maldaptive conditioned responses to power. Or relatedly, there’s a conditioned response to interpret certain things as demands backed by implicit threats, and then there’s their conditioned response to thinking they are being threatened. I need to piece apart conditioning vs reason in order to figure out how to change things, and make all of my cooperative relationship lean into the full power of cooperation, unhindered my the conditioned expectations of threats. 

vgr flavored sociopaths are people who seem to deal with power dynamics with reason and planning. For them “lick the boot because the consequences are worse” means that they actually considered the consequences. They’ve developed a skilled repertoire of reflexive behavior, but it more resembles that of the musician, honed with practice, rather than the scared animal.

aside: I think one reason convos about power dynamics (or struggles spendo has faced in talking about strategic interaction) are hard is because many people are in many genuinely adversarial relationships, and the it behooves the people with more power for their to not be common knowledge about the extent of the adversariality present. At the same time I think that, I also think adversarial expectations are too often ported into cooperative contexts.

I don’t disagree with this as a a very general description, but I want to say why I think “power dynamics” are a solid thing one can get their grasp on, rather than a “flame” that is just the perception of an object that’s the emergent property of a process. The basic is that, in order for cognitive load to be reduced, we tend to carve out power dynamics that _are_ primitives for the purpose of coordination with strangers, acquaintances, and other people we don’t have a deep ability to model. Honorifics and job titles are the classic example of this—one of the biggest reasons why they matter so much is so that _people outside the system_ will be able to make judgements about “what’s going on”. You can tell these titles are load bearing because of all the people who try to bend them in order to get outsized recognition. With cultural ubiquity of certain kinds of relationships (employer/employee) comes coordinating possibility—people know what kinds of things to be sensitive about saying in front of your boss (e.g. that you’re drunk).

This “gift which pray for an answering gift” is always true—but the assurances go deep into the cultural fascia of the roles and relationships we assume other people aren’t willing to violate. This relates to your anarchist grocer. There are many things bosses are legally and practically able to do, but for which they would cause a serious hit to their credibility as an empathizable and respect-worthy in the eyes of their employers, and so they do not. We can reason about these things (in part) from outside the given community precisely because our culture has enough standardized building blocks that “power dynamics” are crystalized into discrete objects.

What’s even more interesting is that power dynamics are “real” enough to culture that people can branch off of known power dynamics to make new ones, without having to purely rely on bottom-up perception to lead to a new kind of relationship having a new kind of name. This is “type of guy” discourse in a nutshell, since most types of guy are really a reduction of certain people into a combination of what other people perceive them to be projecting and what other people assume their power/reach is. “karen” really has to do with (a) what an individual is perceived as demanding from others (b) the actual leverage the individual is perceived as having and © the avenues the individual tends to take in express things e.g. (a) a discount (b) $10 © I want to talk to your manager. The roles are formalized by their relationship to other pre-established roles (manager, customer, social politeness guidance that was ignored, etc.) and therefore doesn’t need endless experimentation in order to be perceived.

In summary, power dynamics are discrete, tractable objects (sometimes) because we purposefully push them to be in order to create a society that has replaceable and reusable parts.
