# on David Chapman and reinventing the wheel

_Tags: [[David Chapman]], [[postrationalism]], [[Hegel]], [[knowledge logistics]]._

[8:04 AM] snav: Chapman is a great example of who i had in mind in the thread

[8:04 AM] snav: he refuses to read even as he reinvents poorly ideas from phenomenology

[8:04 AM] snav: so of course he has no concrete examples because for him it's purely a thought experiment

[8:04 AM] yeetgenstein: i think refusing to read is fine, as a person who often refuses to read :slight_smile:

[8:04 AM] snav: i don't care if someone refuses to read, i care if they're writing and expounding ideas and refuses to do research

[8:04 AM] yeetgenstein: i sense he does have concrete examples in mind, though

[8:04 AM] yeetgenstein: and he has certainly read some things

[8:05 AM] yeetgenstein: i love his post on "ontological remodeling", about pluto

[8:05 AM] yeetgenstein: i want more things like that

[8:05 AM] snav: he has read 80s AI research and that's it

[8:05 AM] snav: and he only read that because he authored some of it

[8:05 AM] snav: oh and Buddhist thought

[8:05 AM] yeetgenstein: didn't he do some bio/pharma startup or something?

[8:05 AM] yeetgenstein: i assume he has experiences from that to share that would be relevant

[8:06 AM] snav: idk also he clearly is into whats his face, Kegan

[8:08 AM] yeetgenstein: anyway

[8:09 AM] yeetgenstein: your criticism is fair

[8:09 AM] yeetgenstein: you're probably right

[8:09 AM] yeetgenstein: i was just inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt

[8:09 AM] yeetgenstein: that he was purposely withholding

[8:09 AM] snav: tbh the sense i get is that chapman is haunted by his own creation lmao

[8:10 AM] snav: "i never wanted this life"

[8:10 AM] yeetgenstein: what is the creation?

[8:10 AM] snav: the meaningness stuff

[8:10 AM] yeetgenstein: his Ultimate Postrationalist Text?

[8:10 AM] yeetgenstein: he is being awfully ... rationalist ... about it

[8:10 AM] snav: that was actually the first postrat text i read

[8:10 AM] yeetgenstein: an ultra-structured work

[8:10 AM] snav: mustve been 2016

[8:10 AM] yeetgenstein: why not just be a little chaotic

[8:10 AM] yeetgenstein: just write snippets, blog posts, that's what he's good at anyway

[8:10 AM] snav: my critique of it i will make directly: the concepts are WEAK

[8:11 AM] snav: he half-invents "bracketing" and then does nothing with it except confuse people with Kegan-like feel-good shit

[8:11 AM] yeetgenstein: it's just "applied kegan" i guess

[8:11 AM] snav: not even

[8:11 AM] snav: it's separate from Kegan, Kegan's model made a little sense

[8:11 AM] snav: Kegan was a Hegelian and his entire central thought process is "dialectics" applied to self-concept

[8:13 AM] snav: Chapman is literally this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_of_hierarchical_complexity#Stages_of_hierarchical_complexity
Model of hierarchical complexity
The model of hierarchical complexity (MHC) is a framework for scoring how complex a behavior is, such as verbal reasoning or other cognitive tasks. It quantifies the order of hierarchical complexity of a task based on mathematical principles of how the information is organized, in terms of information science. This model has been developed by Mi...

[8:14 AM] snav: which i think is quite stupid

[8:14 AM] snav: it's almost a theological model of academic thought

[8:14 AM] snav: I will say "contemplating 16 – meta-cross-paradigmatic (performative-recursive)" is a bit of a mouthful compared to "contemplating God"

[8:17 AM] yeetgenstein: hehe

[8:17 AM] yeetgenstein: it does seem very "80s AI"

[8:18 AM] yeetgenstein: but why is it stupid? do you have a preferred alternative?

[8:18 AM] snav: what is its goal bro

[8:18 AM] snav: what is this doing

[8:19 AM] yeetgenstein: well, i dunno about in the field of psychology, but it seems like a decent set of goals for AI

[8:19 AM] snav: i think "stage theories" are fundamentally flawed

[8:19 AM] snav: sure for AI whatever

[8:21 AM] yeetgenstein: i'm not so against this as you are

[8:21 AM] yeetgenstein: have you ever looked at google's promotion criteria?

[8:21 AM] snav: im against it for psychology but for AI i have no opinion

[8:26 AM] yeetgenstein: i'm interested in this stuff for AI, but also for (as lame as it may sound) career effectiveness

[8:26 AM] yeetgenstein: i also think it may be useful for philosophy around political strategy

[8:26 AM] snav: yeah that's pretty distinct from my interests

[8:28 AM] yeetgenstein: but i also believe there is a strong link between one's "effectiveness" (whether in politics or career or job or family or relationships or organizations) and one's sense of "personal growth"

[8:28 AM] snav: i agree w that i just think it's dumb to put numbers and be like "you're at growth stage 4 but im at stage 5 ha ha"

[8:28 AM] beau: classic stage 4 behavior

[8:29 AM] yeetgenstein: right, i agree, so one should also be meta-rational about applying such numbers

[8:30 AM] djmicrobeads: the idea that i can see myself leveling up is sort of appealing

[8:31 AM] snav: this is precisely why it's bad -- because the numbers in Kegan stages at least represent "stages of self" in the sense that there is no "detached observer stance" you can take and evaluate your own level. so you end up with a "false knowledge"

[8:31 AM] yeetgenstein: i mean it can just be aspirational

[8:32 AM] yeetgenstein: idk

[8:32 AM] djmicrobeads: the levels exist for somebody (a psychologist) to dispassionately say which level somebody is on

[8:32 AM] snav: i think it's a great theory when you strip the numbers out, but you can't "make yourself" "level up"

[8:32 AM] djmicrobeads: imagine me saying dispassionately in a really sarcastic and bitter voice

[8:33 AM] djmicrobeads: yeah snav

[8:33 AM] djmicrobeads: i feel like you can tho

[8:33 AM] djmicrobeads: well

[8:33 AM] djmicrobeads: you can do things that incidentally cause you to become more of an adult i.e. by growing up lmao

[8:34 AM] djmicrobeads: postrats aka the growing-up club. we meet up and discuss what approaches we are gonna use to become grownups

[8:36 AM] yeetgenstein: this article is not exactly correct but it's approximately correct https://qulture.rocks/en/blog/googles-performance-management-practices-part-1/

[8:37 AM] yeetgenstein: sorry to be a corporate drone but i actually think google's promotion criteria and culture around promotion is great and results in better and more effective engineers all around

[9:51 AM] suspended reason: the motherfucker printers fucked our cover up we had to reprint it's a disaster

[9:52 AM] snav: oh nooo :((

[9:52 AM] suspended reason: I don't think they're naive on evo psych, I mean it depends who you're talking about, but [[Sarah Perry]] isn't the type of gal to RT Geoffrey Miller

[9:53 AM] suspended reason: My impression is Chapman spent the 80s only reading German phenomenology. Not disputing that he reinvents, I dunno the literature, just his bio

[9:54 AM] snav: well he could at least give a citation or two along the way to stop people from getting trapped within his own spiral of literature

[9:54 AM] snav: that's all im asking

[9:55 AM] beau: i was more referring to the general tendency of the rationalist community to reach for evolutionary arguments; i haven't read [[Sarah Perry]]

[9:55 AM] snav: so that if someone says "what next" he can be like "well i cribbed this piece from Husserl"

[9:55 AM] snav: because that was really my roadblock in reading him, is i had no clue wtf to read next

[9:55 AM] yeetgenstein: I don’t know if he says you can “make yourself level up”; on the other hand (and this is my main complaint about his work) I think he doesn’t really give any good “exercises” or examples on how one might practice or work towards leveling up

[9:55 AM] yeetgenstein: Maybe our complaints are similar then

[9:56 AM] yeetgenstein: You: what to read next
Me: what to do next

[9:56 AM] suspended reason: oh I see

[9:56 AM] snav: i need to read enough to feel satisfied and then the action is obvious

[9:56 AM] yeetgenstein: But I still sort of think that explicitly and deliberately not tell you what to do, is a good strategy

[9:56 AM] snav: agree

[9:56 AM] suspended reason: smh everyone sleepin on sarah

[9:56 AM] yeetgenstein: The whole point is to figure it out for yourself

[9:57 AM] suspended reason: beau you want a book copy

[9:57 AM] yeetgenstein: Sucks that the book printer fucked it up

[9:57 AM] beau: what's a good place to start?

[9:57 AM] snav: sarah has enough work that she's hard to address fully. i think some of her older work is more or less uncritical evo stuff, grounded in statistical research, which i addressed in the thread

[9:57 AM] snav: her newer stuff i enjoy more, it feels more honest and playful

[9:57 AM] yeetgenstein: Suspended reason has sent me a big list of posts let me dig it up

[9:57 AM] snav: honest about her motive at least

[9:58 AM] suspended reason: did I?

[9:58 AM] snav: and she's always been good at citing stuff so i appreciate that too

[9:58 AM] suspended reason: Her book's a good place to start

[9:58 AM] snav: even if i don't like what she cites

[9:58 AM] suspended reason: Gardens Need Walls is a classic essay

[9:58 AM] suspended reason: and Ritual & the Consciousness Monoculture

[9:58 AM] suspended reason: that's a fun one

[9:58 AM] snav: for whatever reason the latter of those never stuck w me

[9:59 AM] suspended reason: that's true what Snav said I like the playfulness of her [[Sarah Perry|LiteralBanana]] act she started doing fully last year

[9:59 AM] yeetgenstein: Over a year ago

[image]

[9:59 AM] suspended reason: ooh yea

[9:59 AM] suspended reason: Playing Games to Leave Games ain't her tho, psa

[9:59 AM] suspended reason: An Ecology of Beauty & Strong Drink is fun

[10:00 AM] snav: i actually think her "wilderness" one was the most interesting

[10:00 AM] suspended reason: innnteresting

[10:00 AM] suspended reason: that's the one with the city vs wild trees right?

[10:00 AM] snav: precisely because it's so concrete about what it's doing

[10:00 AM] snav: yeah

[10:02 AM] snav: most of her ribbonfarm work i don't find myself ever thinking about

[10:02 AM] snav: but i come back to "wilderness" from time to time

[10:04 AM] suspended reason: don't say that I'm tryna sell books here!

[10:05 AM] snav: lmfao

[10:05 AM] suspended reason: what snav means, beau, is that sarah so profoundly altered his outlook on life that he no longer "thinks" of her, he thinks "through" her

[10:05 AM] suspended reason: she's become like water

[10:05 AM] suspended reason: he can't imagine life without her

[10:05 AM] snav: i don't come back to it because it led me in a direction which was superceded by other stuff i read that was more detailed etc

[10:05 AM] snav: which doesn't mean it's not good/valuable reading

[10:06 AM] snav: i may well not have gotten there had i not started w that

[10:06 AM] suspended reason: snav told me he cried after reading Weaponized Sacredness

[10:06 AM] suspended reason: he'd never read a text that resonated so fully with him

[10:06 AM] snav: i cry whenever i read

[10:06 AM] snav: grieving for the brain cells slowly being hardened into form

[10:06 AM] suspended reason: he has dry eyes

[10:06 AM] snav: yeah it was in the desert

[10:06 AM] suspended reason: lol

[10:07 AM] snav: sarah's work is "of" the desert as well so that made my eyes extra dry

[10:11 AM] suspended reason: tru!

[10:11 AM] suspended reason: she's a desert gal

[10:11 AM] suspended reason: wow I wish I was in the desert

[10:11 AM] suspended reason: you're out right? hw was yr month?

[10:13 AM] snav: yeah im back in brooklyn as of last night

[10:13 AM] snav: it was awesome

[12:52 PM] beiser: i don't have the energy to argue abt it but i think chapman is valuable insofar as he's building texts that are specifically targeting people who are stuck in a naive positivist view of reality

[12:55 PM] beiser: kegan's stages are really a tool for him to justify what kinds of reflection he's trying to make more accessible; there's a reason it shows up in the 'metablog'. i prefer kieran egan's rendering of the territory, but the idea that there there's a scylla of handwavy innumeracy and a charbdis of positivism seems objectively true

[1:07 PM] beiser: you can say he's reinventing things, but I feel like once you reach a certain level of abstraction or insight you're always reinventing things. nothing new under the sun. my theory of insight porn is that if there's an "aha" feeling, it probably is expanding your power level, and the idea that you shouldn't do that because there's some 500 page long Hegelian interpretation of heterotopias that had a similar idea once feels like a way to end up in the thrall of the dumbest bits of the canon

[1:07 PM] beiser: you learn by forgetting as well as remembering

[3:40 PM] beau: i think that there are some things that can only be done by writing for a more general audience and flattening the ideas in ways that are painful for experts

[3:40 PM] beau: and those works often become deeply loved, because they open people up to new ways of thinking

[3:40 PM] beau: who often go on to become experts and then express reservations about them

[3:40 PM] beau: e.g., godel escher bach

[3:41 PM] beau: i haven't gone deep on chapman but it strikes me he's aspiring to make that kind of work

[3:42 PM] beau: i'd buy sarah's book! let me know when i can buy it

# Categories and queer theory

_Tags: [[Matt McKeever]], [[performativity]], [[Jean Francois Lyotard]], [[standpoint epistemology]]._


[5:57 PM] suspended reason: People used to be gun-shy about categories. Hell, in the late 20th C I hear the humanities hated 'em, wrote a buncha treatises on how they were gay and retarded

[5:57 PM] suspended reason: It's just not like it used to be, anymore

[5:59 PM] beiser: Bring Back Deconstruction, Bring Back The Radical Potential of Queering Identities!!!

[6:02 PM] beiser: it is hard for me to take continued terminological churn at its face as being driven by further improvements in underlying theory, rather than a symbolic act to show an enthusiasm for doing something.

[6:02 PM] suspended reason: when I read The Argonauts in 2017—as a semi-reactionary, kinda centrist, Lasch-reading undergrad—I was like, wow, this is totally a picture of queer feminism I can get behind, this rules, I'm so glad I'm on-board with the zeitgeist for once, I can live in harmony with my Barnard peers

[6:02 PM] beiser: on the other hand, i love all people and want to show my enthusiastic support for them, so i will do this too, as a show of my love and respect.

[6:03 PM] suspended reason: little did I realize how wrong I was

[6:03 PM] suspended reason: nobody gives a fuck about flux; there are no consistent meta-level principles or agendas

[6:03 PM] suspended reason: it's all just demography advocacy

[6:10 PM] beiser: i harp on the left sometimes but only because i think it could be good, and i don't think that about the others involved

[6:10 PM] beiser: sometimes u just gotta do ur own thing

[6:11 PM] suspended reason: I harp on the left because literally all my peers are leftist so it's like sitting inside a church sometimes

[6:12 PM] beiser: come to the west coast, we have reactionaries here

[6:12 PM] beiser: they're not any good

[6:12 PM] beiser: but they're here

[6:12 PM] suspended reason: I don't think there's any world in which the left could be good tbh—I think its best intentions are basically all foreclosed on account of a lack of pragmatism / contact with reality. Whatever idealism makes it tic in turn prevents groundedness

[6:13 PM] suspended reason: Not that the right fares better, just sayin

[6:13 PM] beiser: a left could be good

[6:13 PM] suspended reason: Yes

[6:13 PM] suspended reason: that's the big tragedy

[6:13 PM] suspended reason: a good one would be so good

[6:14 PM] suspended reason: Critical but constructive; aware of Chesterton's fences and willing to troubleshoot around them; able and willing to talk about trade-offs and bite bullets

[6:15 PM] beiser: True-Roberto Ungerism has never been tried

[8:02 PM] similaralterity: i think this describes me as well

[8:05 PM] similaralterity: i see very little serious political work/thought in the US, at least, that feels like it's a) realistic and b) not punitive in some fashion

[8:06 PM] similaralterity: it's a bit daunting

[8:44 PM] beau: i think it's good to resist the tendency to collapse popular misreadings of theory with theory itself

[8:44 PM] beau: a lot of what's oppressive in the popular discourse is based on opportunistic misreadings of theory that is both more subtle and more powerful if taken seriously

[8:47 PM] beau: and, in general, my contact with union and housing organizers has been so much more pleasant, realistic, and productive than with, like, woke scolds with very little skin in the game

[8:48 PM] beau: @beiser where are you based?

[8:55 PM] beiser: this is true but i do wonder about how much the underlying theory actually matters in comparison to its popularization ... always suspecting that "nobody actually reads anything"

[8:55 PM] beiser: @beau san francisco

[8:57 PM] suspended reason: Yeah we've talked about this a lot in another Discord I'm in

[8:57 PM] suspended reason: https://suspendedreason.com/2020/06/02/the-telephone-effect-and-the-reciprocity-of-perspectives/

[8:57 PM] suspended reason: You see it constantly too—[[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] in the 20s, Marx throughout the 20th C

[8:58 PM] suspended reason: the "50 words for snow" thing was wild to learn about—that even theorists stopped taking the idea seriously because of its popularization, and it took a real pushback to get it reinstated as canon

[8:59 PM] beau: my most recent encounter with this was i was writing a paper where i wanted to attack an argument that i'd encountered casually but never professionally—that people from different backgrounds could never understand each other. i was told to "read up on standpoint epistemology"

[9:00 PM] beau: so i did and, like, it bears almost no resemblance to the argument i've faced several times in real life that has appropriated its name

[9:01 PM] suspended reason: really?

[9:01 PM] beau: imo

[9:01 PM] beau: yeah

[9:01 PM] suspended reason: can you tl;dr the diff?

[9:01 PM] suspended reason: v curious

[9:01 PM] suspended reason: my favorite take on standpoint epistemology is that it was invented by [[Friedrich Hayek|Hayek]]

[9:02 PM] suspended reason: https://mittmattmutt.medium.com/capitalism-and-grievance-studies-998e039b94d7
Medium
Capitalism Is A Standpoint Epistemology
Attackers of feminist theory who believe in free markets should be careful— the two have some interesting things in common.

[9:02 PM] suspended reason: showing that libertarian and leftist theory agree is like porn to me

[9:03 PM] beau: sure—pop version: "as a member of [identity group], you will never have had my experiences, and so you will never understand me." theory version: "in order for science to function effectively, it's necessary to take social position into account"

[9:03 PM] beau: imo the pop argument is barely in the same universe as what the theorists were talking about, as i read them

[9:04 PM] suspended reason: yeah totally

[9:04 PM] suspended reason: this is how I feel about performativity too

[9:04 PM] beau: and to find an argument that did correspond, i had to go to analytic philosophy

[9:04 PM] suspended reason: I know @snav has a bit on this, about Lyotard and Butler

[9:05 PM] suspended reason: but realizing that "gender is a social performance" has nothing to do with the usual presentation was a real breakthrough for me in undergrad

[9:05 PM] snav: yeah she blew it

[9:05 PM] suspended reason: :laughing:

[9:05 PM] suspended reason: okay I gotta take a quick walk with parentals who I'm in town visitin for holidays

[9:05 PM] suspended reason: but will come back

[9:06 PM] beau: "emotional labor" also

[9:07 PM] beiser: we gotta rectify the names (the wikipedia pages for several popular concepts)

[9:08 PM] snav: if Butler had rectified her names we wouldn't have all this bullshit

[9:08 PM] snav: im dead serious

[9:09 PM] suspended reason: oh I wanna hear the emotional labor steelman

[9:09 PM] snav: Her intentional dual usage of "performative" to mean "acting" and also "performative utterance" is one of the worst abuses of language ive seen in phil

[9:09 PM] beau: the standpoint theory wiki page is a bit of a mess

[9:09 PM] beau: but the emotional labor one at least gets it right at the top

[9:09 PM] suspended reason: I love how strong in feeling this take is snav

[9:09 PM] beau: "Emotional labor is the process of managing feelings and expressions to fulfill the emotional requirements of a job."

[9:09 PM] suspended reason: no equivocation

[9:09 PM] suspended reason: as it should be

[9:09 PM] suspended reason: ahhh

[9:10 PM] snav: yes the extension of emotional labor to situations beyond the service industry

[9:10 PM] snav: was a huge mistake

[9:11 PM] snav: Im mad because it's something with huge social and political impact whose entire grounding is mush

[9:11 PM] beiser: Judith Butler is cancelled on account of her backing Avital when that whole abuse story came out. Which is good and right. But it also means we can cancel her for this use of "performative" in the 90s or whatever.

[9:12 PM] beau: i enjoyed reading butler and remember getting some important stuff out of it

[9:12 PM] beiser: Maybe we can link the two—do we think her elision in the use of "performance" can be construed as hiding abuse somehow

[9:12 PM] beau: hahahaha ooof

[9:12 PM] beiser: that would make it a KO

[9:13 PM] beiser: uncitable

[9:13 PM] snav: apparently when criticized she equivocates so it's impossible to argue against

[9:13 PM] snav: means this or that one moment to the next

[9:14 PM] snav: the only thing i got out of Butler was historical context

[9:14 PM] snav: her language is too abstruse and i say that as someone who has read hegel lacan etc

[9:14 PM] beiser: that butler is somehow up their with rogan as "too big to cancel" is sorta fascinating imo

[9:15 PM] beau: a lot of people invested in the term performativity in popular justifications of their own status as people who deserve to be treated with respect

[9:15 PM] beau: so there's a big emotional investment

[9:15 PM] snav: performativity is when shit does work

[9:16 PM] beau: 'performativity' did some real work

[9:16 PM] beiser: "performativity" was performative  :nail_care:

[9:17 PM] beau: kinda yeah

[9:17 PM] snav: depends

[9:18 PM] beau: but yeah things get weird when a theoretical argument has the kind of resonance that inspires people to use it in their day-to-day life

[9:18 PM] beau: i was really impressed by Cappelen's fixing language

[9:18 PM] beau: he talks about how efforts at deliberate conceptual engineering are likely to always have this quality of getting out of control

[9:19 PM] beau: but how it may be morally necessary to try anyway

[9:52 PM] suspended reason: Damn, is that one early in the series?

[9:53 PM] suspended reason: Matt McKeever, who wrote the capitalism is a standpoint epistemology, worked in Cappelen's lab in Oslo and helped write those, he said they got worse as the series went on

[9:53 PM] suspended reason: But at that point I'd already picked up Bad Language

[9:54 PM] suspended reason: which is one of the later. I had really high hopes, but felt like it just kinda equivocated, the frame never fit quite right
