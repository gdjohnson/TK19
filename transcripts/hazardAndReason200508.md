[7:52 PM] Natural Hazard: @suspended reason  worked out what was bugging me about stacked langauge games
[7:52 PM] Natural Hazard: https://twitter.com/natural_hazard/status/1391177382405492737?s=20

@nosilverv
Ok boys and girls, fourth session today (third was on same topic) with @LisaIRMcNulty. im so upset lol, read on to figure out why. we talked about *the concept* of insanity.

@nosilverv
Basically, having dealt with "insanity" up close (in someone else, not me) i have long been confused by the folk use of the term. It seems to mix up all sorts of things: abnormal, atypical, uncommon, unhealthy, not following norms, delusional, wrong, incorrect and OUTSIDER

@nosilverv
The last concept was given to me by Lisa. The first session was me teasing all of these apart and then she gave me the concept of OUTSIDER which gave me the insight to carry on to the next session.

@nosilverv
I opened today's session by bolding proclaiming I had since figured this out to my satisfaction and setting out to prove it.

@nosilverv
I started by wanting to distinguish two ways of using words (and of using "insane"): what i called 'descriptive' i.e. you are trying to describe reality and what i called 'normative-making' i.e. you are using words to make reality become a certain way

@nosilverv
Think of saying things BECAUSE they are true vs saying things TO make things true

@nosilverv
An example from Lisa: saying 'I do' when you marry makes it true. Words can be, and are used in this way, all the time. ("Do you want to be my girlfriend?" "Yes". Now you are.)

@nosilverv
So "insane" can be used in a "descriptive way" -- not parsing reality (in the same way as [group]?) -- or a "normative-making" way -- an expression that a person should be or is an outcast or outside a social group or a defector (in this way of using words is and should get mixed

@nosilverv
Lisa talked about the history of queer people and how reifying a behavior is a precondition to pathologize it. You didn't have gays before, just guys that had sex with guys, then you did and it was a mental illness and now you do but it isn't.

@nosilverv
I.e. turning behavior into identity is precondition for singling a person or group out. A child who has mistakenly blasphemed out of ignorance is not a "heretic". A heretic is its own category, so that it can be persecuted.

@nosilverv
There just *is* a huge intersection of language and power.

@nosilverv
Around this time I went meta/recursive and asked what the heck was wrong with me lol. Why is it that when I hear a term ('oh, he's just insane') I assume that there is a there-there to be found. I assume person is attempting say-things-because-true

@nosilverv
And obviously, obviously, it's because I'm a quokka or [[rationalism|rationalist]] at heart.

@nosilverv
(Yes, I'm reclaiming this term since now we have [[postrationalism|post-rats]] that were never rats lol. Sorry buddies doesn't work that way, only way out is through, you're not ahead, you're behind.)

@nosilverv
Anyways, going back, basically I was making -- I feel like Wittgenstein is telling all nerds to just stop being nerds and making fun of them lol -- I was making this basic mistake on how to interpret utterance.

@nosilverv
Basically if X is said then the fact is NOT 'X', the fact is 'Y said X'

@nosilverv
Not only that but 'Y said X, and not nearby things X1, X2, ..., Xn. That's the actual fact.

@nosilverv
My interpretation was based on a failure of theory of mind (if you guys call me autist again I swear to god).


@nosilverv
I try to say-words-because-true and so assumed others were doing it too. They're not. Or rather, they're doing say-words-because-true as rarely as I do say-words-to-make-true. It was a complete flip of my interpretation of experience.

@nosilverv
It went from people do 'say-words-because-true' 90% of the time to people do 'say-words-because-true' maybe 10% of the time lol.

@nosilverv
This was obviously HARROWING as I reinterpreted my previous experience. And I could only think of Napoleon crowning himself. It's an act. That's precisely what's happening. People say things as an act and is an act.

@nosilverv
(Apparently the technical term is performative utterance lol https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performative_utterance)


@nosilverv
And like there's a way in which this isn't insidious at all right, as Lisa said, some cultures have different names for colors or some only for 'flying-things' which includes bats and birds and not ostriches and no word for the concept of bird.

@nosilverv
But it also can be insidious and in portugal teenage girls make a hugeeee distinction between blonde and brunette girls bc blondes are rare and brunettes are envious and sneak all kinds of connotations (like blondes are dumb. it's reversed in sweden lol)

@nosilverv
So it CAN be insidious and that's the case in 'he's insane' . It is a TOOL using words as a TOOL so you can make what you want real (have person dismiss that person out of hand, devalue all they say, and kafkatrap them ["I'm not!!!" "Exactly what a crazy person would say..."]

@nosilverv
woah there buddy, calm don't with the 'i don't have an oppositional defiant disorder' defiant opposition lol

@nosilverv
So, basically, wording (finding a word for things) is an act. This act follows and agenda. That agenda can be say-thing-because-true. It can also be say-thing-to-make-true. The latter doesn't have to be insidious but can be.

@nosilverv
Accusation of insanity can be used to attack and pathologize someone as an attack, which preys on using language to say true things. In past examples that I've heard that folk concept being used that's exactly the real intention: "I want you all to dismiss this person out of hand

@nosilverv
It is an exercise left to the reader to figure out who would benefit from doing that and in which situations.

@nosilverv
@HiFromMichaelV @ben_r_hoffman feel like this is right up your alley

@HiFromMichaelV
Most of this is old hat. Your failure was caused by the presence of theory of mind however, not by it's failure. So is Schizophrenia.Autistic people aren't interested in what others are thinking. Schizos think other people must be thinking something that makes them act as they do

@HiFromMichaelV
Normies are just not thinking. They aren't thinking not because they are dumb, nor because they are lying or trying to fool you, but because they are permanently disoriented, literally lost, their minds stripped of the ability to correlate their contents (some call this mercy)...

@HiFromMichaelV
In the absence of Williams Syndrome, children are very aware of threats, and unawareness of threats, like Williams, anti-correlates with mathematical performance, just as Judaism correlates with mathematical performance, threat awareness and Asperger's.

@HiFromMichaelV
I once saw a two or three year old point at some seagulls and ask 'mommy. Will they eat us?'. Children are not into performative imitation. They expect that adults are trying to accomplish things in the material, not just the social universe.
> Fourteen-Month-Olds Adapt Their Imitative Behavior in Light of a Model’s Constraints
> Rather than reenacting every action they observe, preverbal infants adapt their imitative behavior. Although previous studies have revealed the capability of preverbal infants to imitate selectively,...

@HiFromMichaelV
The replacement of representational language by speech acts is the result of abuse. The specific type of abuse that causes it was characterized by Gregory Bateson as the 'double bind'. It's normal within shame-based elite cultures, but their existence is generally parasitic.

@nosilverv
i'm becoming decently convinced of a version of this as well. I'm going to dump all my leads on why it seems like performative speech is not any more "natural" than denotative speech, and it's current supremacy is contingent

@natural_hazard
our boy @theorangealt is out here doing the lords work collecting quotes from this amazing book that's a collection of young childrens relationship to language. it's a sizable sample of a variety of kids all using language VERY "autistically"

@natural_hazard
the book also describes how this way of interacting with language gets dulled over time, often via feedback from their environment

@natural_hazard
another thing that feels like a HUGE indictment is the way that common performative language games "just happen" to be superimposed on top of denotative language suspiciously. in ways were if someone "naively" thinks you're denotative, you benefit from their "mistake"

@natural_hazard
think "wait, wut, you... actually took our code of conduct seriously? Dude, everybody knows its a thing we need to say as part of a performative language game." "everybody knows" mhm. of course. defs not a trap

@natural_hazard
Another tack; communication can't evolve or persist in sufficiently adversarial situations. if performative speech acts were somehow more native or primary, it's just not going to be the case that "secondary and weird" denotive is going to evolve into a way were it's exploited

@natural_hazard
the current weird overlay of perf speech acts on denotive looks a lot more like parasitic behavior. a thing grew and evolved and worked (denotive), and some people fuck with it in a way that brings them advantage to the cost of the health of the original system.

@natural_hazard
recall the LW stuff on [[simulacra]] levels. I think it's really important that those levels are also CHRONOLOGICALLY ordered. Sim level 2 only works if there's a lot of people on sim level 1, 3 only works if there's lots of people at 2

@natural_hazard
same same but diff: there exists rich denotive structure in language. this is structure that everyone has the cognitive capacity to use (us looking at a crowd of 1000s of people, i can say words to any english speaker to pick out unique person). how did this structure come to be?

@natural_hazard
I remember @HiFromMichaelV once saying "some PoMo people gaslight 'nerds', insisting that denotive speech isn't possible." it is BLINDLY OBVIOUS that words can be used denotively. not everyone does that, but insisting that denotive speech doesn't exist is blatant lying

@natural_hazard
i agree that when i look around me, i seem to be immersed in a world of performative speech acts, some of which seem benign ("how are you?") some of which seem predatory. this does seem to be normal as in prevelant. it's NOT normal as in good/necessary/how-things-should-be

@natural_hazard
to clarify, i don't think speech acts themselves are parasitic. commands are speech acts, they have a useful and straight forward place in communication. the thing that i think is parasitic is the current equilibirum of how which denotive words correspond to which speech acts

[8:02 PM] suspended reason: Hmmm
[8:03 PM] suspended reason: What does Vassar mean by speech acts here? It's an idiosyncratic usage
[8:03 PM] suspended reason: I assume by denotative vs performative youre gesturing at neutral representational work vs goal-driven [[strategic interaction|strategic]] representational work?
[8:04 PM] Natural Hazard: this for speech act
speech act is something expressed by an individual that not only presents information but performs an action as well
the standard seems to fit
[8:05 PM] suspended reason: Ehh
[8:05 PM] suspended reason: Now I feel like Snav but [[J.L. Austin|Austin]] means the term in a narrower way than I think this means
[8:06 PM] suspended reason: If you take that description at it's broadest, all language is a speech act; [[J.L. Austin|Austin]] I think means it very narrowly with eg naming a ship or making a promise
[8:06 PM] Natural Hazard: what about "move in a langauge game" or "the thing rival is clearly talking about"?
[8:06 PM] suspended reason: I should read up in thread context though
[8:06 PM] suspended reason: One thing I think continental folk would say is that there are language games where neutral representation is "winning play," or where players use the neutral (most accurate)
[8:06 PM] suspended reason: I haven't read Rival's yet
[8:06 PM] suspended reason: One sec going up thread
[8:14 PM] suspended reason: Yeah I mean
[8:14 PM] suspended reason: I stand by what I said
[8:14 PM] suspended reason: I get why Rival is trying to broaden the original meaning of performative
[8:15 PM] suspended reason: But performative statements can't even be contested
[8:15 PM] suspended reason: If the person saying them is ritually empowered to pronounce them, they're true on utterance
[8:15 PM] suspended reason: If I say "I name my boat HMS Spendy" and I own the boat, and sign the paperwork, no one contest my boat name, it's not even a descriptive claim to evaluate
[8:16 PM] suspended reason: The slip here is that Rival thinks that [[strategic interaction|strategic representational]] work "makes things true" instead of "trying to capture truth"
[8:16 PM] suspended reason: But it doesnt
[8:16 PM] suspended reason: If I claim someone is insane that is contestable. If I say I'm six feet tall, that can be empirically measured and disputed
[8:17 PM] suspended reason: I'm just presenting the socially or [[strategic interaction|strategically beneficial representation]] instead of the one I think will be most accurate, in a correspondence sense
[8:19 PM] Natural Hazard: what part of what you said do you think we're not on the same page about?
[8:21 PM] suspended reason: I think Rival's use of "speech act" and "performative" are misuses — I get why he is trying to expand the concept that way, it's about speech that does something, and helps create a reality, but "performative" is a narrow subset of pragmatic or goal oriented language usage
[8:22 PM] suspended reason: And non-authoritative representational claims eg "he is insane" cannot by definition by performative or a speech act
[8:22 PM] suspended reason: This is my understanding tho @snav or @crispy_chicken might disagree
[8:23 PM] suspended reason: (I say this as someone who has been tempted to use performative in a similarly expansive way in the past, so maybe I'm projecting onto Rival)
[8:23 PM] Natural Hazard: dope, that's a convo we could have, it seems like it would be useful to , but I'm way more interestsed in what you think about the stuff I was tweeting about. Do you have a sense of what I was pointing at enough to think about the claims?
[8:24 PM] suspended reason: Oh word I was just talking about that specific phrase
[8:24 PM] Natural Hazard: or does it feel like we actually need to work out the terms thing first?
[8:24 PM] suspended reason: Lemme re-read your thread now in light of Rival's
[8:25 PM] suspended reason: Maybe let's just shore up this?
[8:27 PM] Natural Hazard: denotive is speaking literally, how you speak when you're working on working on your engineering homework withsome else and you both get diff answers, sharing information, speaking "straightforwardly", there's a particular person in a crowd I'm trying to point out and i'm saying words till we're on the same page about the person i'm thinking of, etc
[8:27 PM] suspended reason: Yeah it seems like there are two metaphors one is stacked layers the other is freeriding on an existing strategy, and I think the second is better/truer
[8:27 PM] suspended reason: Your point about how communication breaks down in highly adversarial conditions is important and interesting
[8:28 PM] suspended reason: Its true--in pure conflict you wanna block out all messages from your opponent
[8:28 PM] suspended reason: If he even gets a message through and you hear it you could be compromised
[8:28 PM] Natural Hazard: and also in simple signaling games, in pure conflict shared meaning never even evolves in the first place
[8:28 PM] Natural Hazard: where as it does when intersts align
[8:28 PM] suspended reason: This seems different however from saying that in highly adversarial conditions, interaction would break down
[8:29 PM] suspended reason: Because even without communication, taken in the neutral representation exchange sense, there is still plenty of reading and writing
[8:29 PM] suspended reason: Any costly or hard to fake cues will still be available to size up your opponent
[8:29 PM] suspended reason: Its just that voluntarily delivered messages by your opponent are valueless
[8:31 PM] suspended reason: At the same time, because in signaling games deception evolves so quickly on top of honest signals that I can't imagine there was ever a period of real honesty that eventually was parasitized. My guess would be that speech and deception emerged pretty concurrently
[8:32 PM] suspended reason: My guess is [[frequency dependent selection]] is the really important variable here
[8:32 PM] suspended reason: You need a population to tell mostly truths in order for people to interpret mostly naively
[8:32 PM] suspended reason: And at least personally that's still a huge question mark for me—how do we keep people so damn honest ??
[8:33 PM] suspended reason: See somewhat related thread https://twitter.com/suspendedreason/status/1386897202916724737?s=20

Suspended Reason (@suspendedreason)
@peligrietzer @[[Sarah Perry|literalbanana]] What curtails our constantly exaggerating our accomplishments? What is the leash that tethers us to truth? How to we verify and cross-check information others provide us, in a way that keeps people more often than not?

[8:35 PM] suspended reason: One thing I wonder about is whether we really should see denotative or neutral representational work as a subset of [[strategic interaction|strategic representational work]]
[8:37 PM] suspended reason: Because in some non trivial sense, it seems like there's an equally pragmatic shaping of a message for context/relevance/grounding even in neutral representation work—"How do I say it so they'll understand the sense I wanna get across which I think informs their problem and context at hand" isn't so different from "How do I say it so they'll understand it in the sense that makes me look good"
[8:38 PM] suspended reason: Maybe the difference between saying one is a subset vs saying they're rival strategies is just empty conceptual framing/ontological flex stuff? Hard to say
[8:40 PM] Natural Hazard: Yeah, interjecting on last bit. If think of [[strategic interaction||strategic representation]] as not just "how am I displaying things rn?" but "what logic originally formed these categories and representations that I use and sometimes communicate through speech" I'm happy to note that "does a good job of broadly communicating detailed info the in the context of our 'field'" is a goal that shapes categories
[8:41 PM] Natural Hazard: (gonna take a break, be back in a few)
[8:42 PM] suspended reason: Yeah and I guess the problem, if you wanna call it that, is all language is strategic in this sense, period
[8:43 PM] suspended reason: And all language is manipulative in the sense of wanting to change humans' behavior in a way relevant to ones goals
[8:43 PM] suspended reason: If I shout your name across the room to get your attention, or ask you about dinner, or tag you on discord, I'm trying to make you do something
[8:44 PM] suspended reason: Sometimes I might "just" be shaping your beliefs but the reason is downstream I think your modified beliefs will lead to better outcomes for me
[8:45 PM] suspended reason: I think we probably fall into a ton of heuristics for utterance "value," rather than doing cost benefit analysis for every minutia of talk, so there are inevitably things we say or do that cost us more than they help us, but I think that's the broad algorithm that makes sense
[8:46 PM] suspended reason: And of course, a Goffmanian note, we can play for teams—I am not just strategic ok behalf of myself but perhaps loved ones, ideologies, social groups etc
[8:49 PM] suspended reason: Here's a provocation: if we're communicating with a machine, all we care about is the outcome, right? Like the "correct" representation for "X," in the command "Identify all X in this image," is whatever description of X leads the machine to pick out all X
[8:50 PM] suspended reason: So in this idea of accuracy or neutral denotation, there's almost this idea of interpretive freedom: that the receiver of the communication can judge in a way that is representative of their real feelings, if they interacted with "the thing itself" instead of your representation
[8:51 PM] suspended reason: If you have "weighted the scales" for them you're seen as manipulating them, as creating propaganda, as pulling rhetorical tricks
[8:52 PM] suspended reason: But in some sense all that's important is giving them a description that lets them make an assessment they would deem fair--not altering or omitting details they'd find pertinent, not adding false details which might sway them
[8:58 PM] suspended reason: This actually seems like it has the potential to become a thornier issue—imagine if my friend Bob is hiring at his firm, and asks me to help him find the best candidate. Bob has a deep prejudice against people born in the South, and wouldn't hire anyone from there. I hook him up with Caroline, a fantastic employee who was born in Georgia but has no trace of her Southern accent. When I brief Bob on Caroline, I don't mention the Georgia bit; he loves her in the interview and hires her. On one hand, I've manipulated him by omitting information I know that he would find useful in decision-making; on the other hand, I don't think her being born in Georgia will at all diminish her quality as an employee. And it doesn't seem like there's a clear truth to which one of us has "neutrally attested" vs "manipulatively fabricated"
[9:16 PM] Natural Hazard: So i'm pretty onboard with all of the literal claims you're making above, and most of the claims you're making in between this and my last message. It also feels like saying all that is relevant if you were responding to someone proposing something like, "It is always obvious what 'neutral' means, and in fact here is a rationalist (chapman sense) specification for what consitutes as neutral." Actuallly, every thing you've said feels most useful as a response to someone (high modernist, iFuckingLoveScience type) who is strategicly and ingenuously invoking the idea of neutrality to justify a set of representation they want used. Like, the people who say "it's easy, just listen to science, cuz it's neutral" I think mostly aren't rationalist "i've got the perfect spec!" types. The way most people invoked the "neutrality of science" during covid seems like a great example for people who what you're saying would be a useful response to
[9:17 PM] Natural Hazard: All that being said, I can look at my life and see people who communicate with me a lot more or less honestly/neutrally than others. I would learn something very surprising if it wasn't the same for you.
[9:18 PM] Natural Hazard: What I'm addressing in my tweets is those clusters, the clusters were I'm pretty sure if we had a longer convo we'd both be like "yeah, those people are fucking with language way more than those other people"
[9:19 PM] suspended reason: Totally, it's like trying to short-circuit my own evaluative independence—they've determined for me what the correct interpretation is, and curated/massaged information that matches that interp. It sucks!
[9:20 PM] Natural Hazard: I'll also flag, based on something you mentioned in the thread you linked, I'm defs not onboard with "lying was invented in the 80s" (we've all read Jaynes, everyone knows lying was invented in the axial age :smirk: )
[9:21 PM] suspended reason: But I think where we maybe crucially differ is I think that strategic (in the sense of team-goal-furthering) speech is the primitive, that can be constrained by cultural technologies for monitoring utterances, networking reputations, etc. Whereas it seems that you disagree
[9:22 PM] Natural Hazard: yeah!
[9:23 PM] suspended reason: I don't think your stance is silly, it's def interesting that (perhaps?) children are less manipulative/strategic, and your idea of chronology sorta makes sense too. I wonder if we'd really have to get into the origins of language—as some ethologist whose name I've forgotten has said, one of the reasons that many species don't have advanced language is it wouldn't be all that useful unless they already had strong coordination norms
[9:24 PM] suspended reason: I'm not sure if I totally believe that but there's something maybe real there about coordination needing to come first
[9:23 PM] Natural Hazard: with my main disagreements being anecdotes about how children interact with language, and then also theoretical takes on conditions required for certain structure to evolve
[9:23 PM] Natural Hazard: as v briefly explored in the thread
[9:24 PM] suspended reason: I wish I'd read more of the origins of language/origins of signaling lit
[9:25 PM] Natural Hazard: I'm super excited to read more about children! That actually seems like one of the more promising angles to figure out what's going on. I'll probably dig into that in the coming weeks and report back
[9:25 PM] suspended reason: Yeah, would be interesting
[9:25 PM] suspended reason: Note though that babies are famously manipulative
[9:26 PM] suspended reason: they cry when nothing's wrong b/c they've learned it gets mommy's attention
[9:26 PM] Natural Hazard: yo, this actually super motivates me to do some writeups, maybe with built in simulations, about some of the basic dynamics. Like, it's by no means an open and shut argument, but there's stuff there's some basic principles/dynamics there that are verycompelling to me
[9:26 PM] suspended reason: In some sense all crying "is" is a demand for attention, and sometime's its legitimate (the baby's in trouble) and sometimes the baby just wants attention, and the mom can't really determine which
[9:26 PM] suspended reason: oh! see also the Sir Philip Sidney game with begging chicks
[9:27 PM] suspended reason: In some sense, right, language being representational instead of an action rule is like, super weird, right?
[9:31 PM] Natural Hazard: my quick take, to be expanded on, goes something like this: my parasitic, things i"m mostly tapping into are 1) destructive to the host and 2) small. Parasites that do too much damage don't survive. So deception being around since the early days is something i could be on board with, with the requirement that it be a minority. The vibe i get from my current life is that "most" shit i interact with is deceptive in a strong sense. That weirds me out, in a "shouldn't everything have imploded already? Like, this does not seem like a sustainable level of deception, so either its a recent change [for some unknown value of recent] or....[????]. [[Simulacra]] levels are a useful frame for me for understanding layers that feed off each other, and kinda acts as a way to "control the implosion".
[9:37 PM] suspended reason: Yeah I think we have different intuitions on this
[9:38 PM] suspended reason: My guess is that a lot of stuff is less deceptive these days because informational oversight + verification technology is much stronger, from resumes/background checks, to unified social identities (if you keep a LinkedIn, you have to have one central version of truth—you can't tailor your background to every company), to credit scores, to more standardized grading in secondary schools, etc etc
[9:38 PM] suspended reason: I agree things are heavy on bullshit; I just think that's a pretty universal state of affairs, from the animal to human kingdoms
[9:39 PM] suspended reason: OTOH, if you look at like, village structures, then things are definitely more stable
[9:40 PM] suspended reason: I'd cede that small communities, people know each other in deeper, more long-term ways—they're not "thin-slicing" each other. They're not trying to measure people by [[surrogation|proxies]] like a resume or interview. The village blacksmith just knows Johnny, known him since he grew up
[9:41 PM] suspended reason: To me, the transformation from local to global communities, and the explosion of "distant credentials," means more [[surrogation|surrogates]], which means more room for degenerate exploits, just more reliance on representations and thin-slicing generally, so there's more leeway for [[strategic interaction|strategic distortion of representations]]
[9:42 PM] suspended reason: I wonder if the level of bullshit necessarily stays within certain +- bounds because it's synonymous with the amount of coordination that can happen at a certain organizational scale
[9:42 PM] suspended reason: Like, if you have a distant global system of evaluation, and no technologies for certification/verification of people's self-representational claims (e.g "I was a foreman back east"), then you're just fucked, you can't do it
[9:44 PM] suspended reason: Here, it's not so much/just that technology came in to help overcome the higher-reliability rates of "distant" evaluation, but that technology enabled more "distant" evaluation to happen reasonably reliably
[9:49 PM] Natural Hazard: Aside, do you use simulacra levels to think about things?
[9:49 PM] Natural Hazard: I find it a bit more useful than truth->deception->bullshit
[9:52 PM] suspended reason: No, I think the [[simulacra]] frame is a dead-end, TBH. I think it's on to something, but I don't think structurally it quite captures the relationships. There's the idea of free-riding honest communication, which I think is important. And there's the idea that the "kind of person" who does X linguistic act accrues a connotative/associative weight, such that people will change their language to project a certain image. But the 1-2-3-4 "levels" metaphor doesn't quite resonate with me/feels like it misleads, and the equal weighting between the four levels doesn't quite feel right to me either
[9:52 PM] suspended reason: So I guess, I think the parts it points out are right and important, I just don't love how it organizes or conceptualizes the relationship between these parts
[9:52 PM] suspended reason: Not that I have a better metaphor lying around
[9:58 PM] suspended reason: The way I usually talk about these things is that the associative weight, accumulated through a sociological history of usage, is the "fashion" consideration or landscape, subject to normal fashion innovation-->adoption-->saturation cycles. But that this fashion aspect is in some meaningful sense just "optics-mization" (the self-representing party wants to put on the most strategically valuable self-representation possible, which in most cases can be simplified to the most flattering self-representation possible) plus the mechanics of connotation fields more widely (why call Jim developmentally delayed instead of retarded?). It's not atomic so much as a narrow venn overlap between two more importantly atomic effects.
[9:59 PM] suspended reason: But I think these conceptual framings are super hard to be rigorous about, so that's mostly an intuition. Plus, as we've talked about before, the frame you choose often is most about what problem you wanna solve, and maybe those guys are trying to think specifically about political, coalition-building language, in which case prioritizing group-affiliation "X kinda person says Y"-type statements as a pseudo-primitive makes more sense?
[10:19 PM] Natural Hazard: Dope. I think my thinking on simulacra has evolved a good bit away from some of the LW, and I'd love to write a post on it some time.
