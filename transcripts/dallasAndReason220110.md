[3:09 AM] Dallas: @suspended reason I can't seem to find the original link, but I thought I would comment here on "All Communication is Manipulation" (which I see is now unprotected, and may have changed substantially from the browser tab I've had sitting open, lol). Somehow I feel like it's still not hitting quite the right mark, although it's hard to say exactly why.  I think maybe it has something to do with how you're lumping, splitting, or possibly blurring things (or I might just be missing the point entirely).
[3:10 AM] Dallas: Partly I'm still trying to figure out the limits of your claims and what effects you're trying to achieve. There are many different claims that could be made, all under the same banner. One such claim, for example, could be that whenever we deliberately speak to someone (with the assumption they can hear us), we are intending to affect them in some way. This is almost tautologically true (and is of course less than you are claiming), in so far as them hearing our voice entails some modification of their physical state.
[3:10 AM] Dallas: On another level, you're saying something like communication is a behaviour, all behaviours are the product of evolution, and those that persist do so because they tend to improve the success of organisms with that behaviour, which generally involves modifying the world around them. Therefore, we can assume that the "purpose" of communication is the modification of the world around us. Again, this is quite unobjectionable as far as it goes, although brining in purpose starts to get a bit messier.
[3:11 AM] Dallas: But you also seem to go a bit farther, which seems to be something like, when we communicate, we are doing so to advance our goals, as long as we understand goals to mean not just our conscious objectives, but also goals that we are not even aware of, whether subconscious or evolutionary. This is where I think things get a bit less solid. First, because if we define our goals as that which is advanced by anything we do, this becomes kind of tautalogical and potentially very counterintuitive in some cases. Second, just because some behaviour is the product of evolution, this does not mean it is beneficial for us as individuals (for all who exhibit that behaviour). There are all kinds of things we can point to that bring (or used to bring) benefits on average, but are detrimental or deadly to individuals (when present with other oddities or whatever)
[3:11 AM] Dallas: I think one of the things you're trying to get at is to say communication is more like e.g., blushing that we typically think (or would you just straight up call blushing communication?). Blushing seems like a weird things for humans to do, but it is clearly a kind of signaling, and we can come up with lots of theories about why it may have contributed to evolutionary fitness, and so persists.
[3:12 AM] Dallas: But you also point to ways in which we use communication to try to explicitly modify the world so as to advance our conscious goals, and I think suggest that all communication is like a mix of these two. You say "that our aimed-for outcomes, in manipulating others’ models of the world via representational work, are always both narrow and broad, specific and vague" but I don't really understand why it should always be both? Aren't there cases where it's very much one of the extremes?
[3:13 AM] Dallas: As a kid of edge case, I might point to Tourette's syndrome. For those people who can't stop themselves from blurting out offensive words, it seems pretty clear that such communication is not advancing their conscious goals. It might be said to have a manipulative purpose, in so far as the genes which produce that behaviour have been selected for and persist. But that doesn't mean that such behaviour is serving any purpose for that individual. It could just be that they exist for some unrelated benefit, and in certain extreme cases exhibit this particular detriment. You could also go more meta and say that the existence of people with Tourette's serves to make society better in some way, but it seems like almost anything could be incorporated as good or useful with that same move, making it somewhat meaningless. Or you could say that such behaviour is not communication, but then it becomes very fuzzy to me what you are and aren't counting.
[3:13 AM] Dallas: Similarly it feels like, in the same vein, one could just as easily say "all not communicating is manipulation".
[3:13 AM] Dallas: One minor point: you mention "defining manipulation as the morally neutral alteration of an agent’s state or behavior", but surely you don't mean all alteration is morally neutral, but rather that you're not limiting your meaning of manipulation to nefarious cases?
[3:14 AM] Dallas: On the other hand, I quite liked where you say "Rather than seek incredibly specific outcomes, we recognize that there are entire classes of outcomes which are approximately commensurate in terms of advancing our immediate and long-term interests, and we are more or less agnostic to which entry from that class ends is selected by the interlocutor." This made me think of the goal of making someone aware of information. We might not expect any particular behaviour from them in response, but just want to see what they will do with it!
[1:23 PM] suspended reason: Yeah, I think you've exactly identified the way that my thinking on this issue is still muddled—the defense via evolution vs the more tautological claims, whether I'm offering a re-definition of communication or identifying the purpose of all information-creating self-expression
[1:24 PM] suspended reason: Let me first try and clarify/address some other easier points, and then I'll make an attempt to de-muddle the larger problem
[1:26 PM] suspended reason: You say that the weak version of my claim is that when we deliberately speak to someone, we are intending to affect them in some way. I actually this is closer to my thesis then you might expect. Which is: "we are intending to affect them, and this affecting cashes out in behavioral alteration." That communication is an action, and like any other action, we undertake it to transform the world, and yet it is a special kind of action, where that transformation requires the transformation of a (receiving) agent's behavior; it modifies the world through another agent. (Because this is the only way information alters the world: through an agent capable of being altered by it.)
[1:27 PM] suspended reason: Taking this seriously, there will only be communication happening in ML when the agents have desires they are trying to accomplish through their speech.
[1:31 PM] suspended reason: I think the Tourette's example, though a good edge case, is probably handled by the "deliberately" part of the definition. I don't really understand Tourette's (I'm not sure anyone does yet?) so it's difficult to speculate, but I'll readily cede there is a plethora of information-creation that is not intended to alter others behaviors. For instance, if I scratch my butt or pick my nose in private, I almost certainly am doing it for the "intrinsic" effects it accomplishes (e.g. relieving the itch) and not to alter an observer's behavior (because I think I'm not being observed). But sometimes people do scratch their butt or pick their nose in public, and these actions do create effects, and sometimes these effects are desired by the acting agent, and sometimes they're not. And in the former case, I'd call this a kind of communication, and in the latter case I wouldn't, because—tautologically, maybe—I think communication "just is" the attempt to alter others' behavior via information.
[1:32 PM] suspended reason: This is where we get into all the tricky stuff about conscious vs unconscious, and intended vs unintended—I don't have a great strategy for dealing with this stuff, other than to follow @crispy_chicken's "argument from history" idea, that we use "intent" as an abstraction of "what will this agent do in the future, for the purposes of our predicting," and that, if an agent regularly produces results which could not occur by chance, then they are essentially intending, or desiring/pursuing, these results, even if not consciously.
[1:33 PM] suspended reason: So, we can say that, no person "intends" in the conscious decision-making sense to breathe, but because people manage to continue respirating for decades, which would not happen "on its own" or by chance or through thermodynamic equilibrium, then agents desire/intend to breathe.
[1:35 PM] suspended reason: And I think this is basically where I stand on communication, that individuals performing expressive acts, verbal and non-verbal, typically get effects which are positive for them far more often then we'd expect by chance, then the purpose or desire of these expressive acts is creating positive effects
[1:36 PM] suspended reason: Re: "One minor point," Correct, I should figure out a rephrase. Maybe "morally agnostic."
[1:38 PM] suspended reason: I think my argument is, in general, far more tautological and obvious than it has often been read as, but more of a paradigm-shift than a tautology would imply, because the immediate implication, in my mind, is that literal semantic content as we often think of "meaning" is always secondary to desired effects, and this moves us from literalists to psychologists in our understanding of linguistic "meaning"
[1:39 PM] suspended reason: Re: "But you also point." Oh, last point that needs addressing—yeah, so here I think I can actually add more clarity than muddle; what I mean by this is, "We always desire a relatively narrow sub-space of all possible outcomes, but that relatively narrow sub-space is in absolute terms, often quite broad"
[1:41 PM] Dallas: Re: "You say that": Ah yes, I do think this gets at something very interesting! You alluded to it in multiple places, and so I had a feeling it might be central to your thinking, but I wasn't sure whether it was separate or deeply connected -- communication is special in that we can have almost unlimited reach, without needing to directly affect things far away, simply by getting others to do certain things (cf memes, religions, etc.)
[1:43 PM] Dallas: Re: "The Tourette's," Okay cool, this makes sense to me. I guess the interesting thing is that almost any signal can be weaponized to some extent. Certain physiological behaviours might be very difficult to fake, but sheer offensiveness is a line that is easy to cross, if one is intent on doing so.
[1:43 PM] Dallas: Re: "So, we can say that" Hmm, this is interesting. I will have to think about this part more...
[1:45 PM] Dallas: Re: "And I think this," Yes, I think I am starting to see the power of this more now. It allows us to see a wide range of linguistic acts with a someone more realist perspective, from children complaining, to people sharing their personal stories at public meetings, to those who are just asking questions
[1:46 PM] Dallas: Re: "I think my argument is," Yes, I like this! And it connects to the narrow vs broad as well. In many cases we might ask a question not so much to gain information, but for the effects the question will produce
[1:48 PM] Dallas: This also connects deeply to debates (which I tend to avoid) involving rationalists critiqueing their conception of postmodernism. The one point that people often can't seem to get past is that writing in a way where you tell people exactly what you are doing (possibly by just following conventions), is not the only to influence people. Strategic ambiguity can be extremely powerful!
[1:50 PM] suspended reason: Right—I love defenses that start "Just X" like "Just asking questions," "Just stating a fact," because on the one hand, why that fact, why that question, don't tell me there isn't some kind of agenda. On the other hand, the speaker is trying to downplay that agenda, and say, there are some "stronger" reads of my intended effects here which I disavow in favor of a "weaker" read
[1:50 PM] suspended reason: That weaker effect can just be "I want us to hash out and deliberate and actually consider this angle of the problem"
[1:51 PM] Dallas: Yes, there's a kind of recursion here. You may be asking questions, but how do you justify your use of "just", haha!
[1:51 PM] Dallas: (not you, of course, the hypothetical speaker)
[1:54 PM] suspended reason: What do you think the main things I could add to the original post for greater clarity? I'm considering adding something like the bit about "yes, this is sorta tautological, but if you take it seriously you shift from literalist to psychologist about meaning," and maybe the argument about intentionality/deliberateness. Anything else that felt like it was ambiguous in the original, but my messages helped clear up?
[1:55 PM] suspended reason: (thanks for bearing with me as I manipulate you to help me write better) 
[1:56 PM] Dallas: Or is it I who am manipulating you?? hahaha
[1:56 PM] Dallas: I guess my main thought is that the current post tries to take on too much, and tries to weave things together in a way that leaves all of them a bit unclear
[1:57 PM] Dallas: This can be a very powerful approach when it works well, but I'm not sure it totally comes together here
[1:58 PM] Dallas: I think a way that I might try to put this would be something like "all communication has effects on multiple levels" or something like that. This is pure Austin, but I think it might help to get people on the same page. We can't cleanly think of communication as just sending semantic information in abstract form.
[1:58 PM] Dallas: (This also makes me think that I want to re-read Derrida's take on Searle on Austin) 
[1:59 PM] Dallas: Maybe then start with the clearest cases, where we very much want to affect some particular change in the world (brining in the point about reach), and provide examples
[1:59 PM] Dallas: But then trouble the waters by questioning what counts as our intentions, and lead people down that slippery slope
[2:00 PM] Dallas: It's also interesting because the current post takes the form of responses to objections. I think this is a very useful format, but maybe would work better as an accompaniment to a post that focuses less on objections and more on the core ideas
[2:02 PM] Dallas: I certainly do think it is worth retaining the evolutionary aspects, because that is central on at least some level. At the same time, I think you need to admit to a fair bit of uncertainty there, both because evolution is smarter than us, and because I think humanity is becoming increasingly untethered from biological evolution such that it's not clear we can just perfectly map the thinking about bio to culture. (It could be that we can, I just think it's less certain).
[2:03 PM] Dallas: I guess another alternative is to suggest that your framing helps to unify two different perspectives on communication -- one in which we are deliberately speaking to get what we want, and another in which language is speaking us (a la Heidegger) because it is an evolutionary behaviour
[2:04 PM] suspended reason: Ooh, what's this?
[2:05 PM] suspended reason: Is that what Austin ends up arguing in his speech acts stuff? That language is about effects? I read the first half and sorta got frustrated b/c I'm not sure I believe in the speech act concept as it was formulated, but Crispy seemed to imply in messages that Austin himself starts complicating the speech act concept as maybe a more general principal of language, the way I sorta see it
[2:08 PM] Dallas: Yes, I think HTDTwW is definitely worth reading, perhaps especially paired with Derrida. As I recall, Austin starts off by wanting to point out that communication has effects in the world beyond our traditional notions of communication. Specifically speech acts like the act of marrying people causes important changes to take place, in such a way that it is kind of like a different sort of act than just communicating. (I'm muddling this, but that's close to the gist).
[2:09 PM] Dallas: But, as Derrida points out, Austin gets increasingly bogged down as he goes along, trying to work out what is and isn't communication.
[2:10 PM] Dallas: The things which makes Derrida's take so delicious, is that Searle (of the chinese room) at some point picked up Austin and tried to own speech act theory in philosophy, and Derrida just performs this incredible take down of that. So it's partly about Austin, but also about Searle (and all about communication)
[2:10 PM] Dallas: Here's the book: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_Inc
[10:53 PM] suspended reason: Re: "But you also seem," Can you give examples of cases where people communicate information in a way that (they expect will) make them worse off?
[10:54 PM] suspended reason: Or rather, I should say, which sabotages their goals?
[10:54 PM] suspended reason: I can see e.g. people doing things that hurt their own interests while helping out a friend, because part of the person's priorities includes their friend's well-being
[10:55 PM] suspended reason: But it's hard for me to picture communication that isn't performed to advance a goal if only at some macro level like "make friends" and "be well-liked" and "help the company perform smoothly"
[10:56 PM] suspended reason: If I write a book, ostensibly I do it to accomplish goals like "advance human knowledge" and "become a famous author who makes lots of money," and my micro-decisions for word choice or sentence structure or idea presentation ostensibly follow these goals
[10:57 PM] suspended reason: Additionally, do you think people don't have subconscious goals that their behaviors advance? This to me seems like one of the foundational and more accepted insights of psychoanalysis, seeing as its been picked up so broadly in psychology under the flag of self-deception
[11:11 PM] suspended reason: In thinking more about the difference between "altering something through force" and "altering it through communication," I've begun to think of information and intelligence very differently
[11:12 PM] suspended reason: That is, I think I've come to see intelligence as the evolved ability to be manipulated by information
[11:13 PM] suspended reason: Information "just is" a thing that alters intelligent agents, because intelligence "just is" the dynamic response of an agent to information
[11:14 PM] suspended reason: To produce information "just is" to alter intelligent agents
[11:14 PM] suspended reason: The question that gets tough is the question of intent or purpose, what do intelligent agents produce information "for"
[11:15 PM] suspended reason: And in the animal kingdom, we answer this by saying, "Regardless of the phenomenology of what drives a bee to dance, the fact that it reliably alters the behavior of other bees—reliably in the sense of 'way above what you'd expect from chance'—means it's 'for' altering the behavior of other bees"
[11:17 PM] suspended reason: Now, imagine if you were watching a movie, and every time any characters communicated, the interaction became a black box, or was just erased entirely from the film. Would any of the characters' actions make much sense, without the information they'd gotten from other characters? Would we understand why James Bond decides to motorboat to the Maldives, if it wasn't for his assignment from M?
[11:20 PM] suspended reason: I think there remains some real mystery in how social hangouts, chatting, etc fits into this picture, but this stuff feels weird and not central to what communication is and has been historically for human beings. Making small talk or arguing about metaphysics is kinda weird, and while we can easily point to the small ways manipulations happen—when you ask a question, you're trying to get them to give you an answer—but the larger "purpose" and goals of these interactions seem tricky to understand, you don't wanna get reductive about them and say they're "just" about signaling status or someth
[11:22 PM] suspended reason: But when we think about communication protypally, when we think about what it means when someone says "You need to communicate X information to Y," or "I wish you communicated with me more," it's precisely because that information would alter its receiver's behavior
[11:23 PM] suspended reason: Part of me is tempted to just taboo the words "purpose" and "for" and "intend" and just give a descriptive "All communication is manipulation" argument that takes the stance that, inevitably, information alters us, it's what information is, and communication is the production of information
