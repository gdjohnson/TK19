alias: German Youth Movement, Wandervogel

The German Youth Movement began in the late 1800s with the Wandervogel. The movement began as an anti-industrial, anti-imperial, romantic movement interested in nature, confraternity, and adventure.

A. W. Carus, _Carnap and Twentieth Century Thought_:
> The Youth Movement that began around 1900 in the wealthier suburbs of Berlin has hardly begun to be understood. It would appear to be the first example of something that has become quite familiar in post-1945 industrial societies: a large-scale rebellion of well-off adolescents against the perceived conformism of their parents and teachers to the rigid norms of the society into which students were being socialised.

> Drawing heavily on German Romanticism, with its idealisation of medieval and primitive societies, the Youth Movement appealed to teenagers who perceived only complacent materialism and monotony in the mass society around them. They yearned instead for the heroic ideals and the simplicity of bygone ages, the stability of traditional society, contact with nature, and the simple life of peasants. In the late 1890s a group of schoolboys in the wealthy Berlin suburb of Steglitz began to arrange expeditions to the countryside, where they took long walks together. They sang as they walked, and carried as little as possible in their knapsacks; the idea was to adapt to local conditions, eat the plain food of the local peasantry, abstain from ‘city’ vices such as alcohol, coffee, and tobacco, and sleep in barns or under the open sky. The group called itself the Wandervogel (‘bird on the move’). They hoped that direct contact with nature would heal them of the decadent and over-indulgent habits of urban civilisation, and would correct the one-sidedness and overspecialisation inherent in modern life. They wanted to be ‘whole human beings’, overcoming the alienation described in an oft-quoted passage from Holderlin.

> As the [German Youth] movement became national, it also developed its own culture and terminology, along with certain standard rituals and practices... It also split, as such movements do, into rival factions. The original leader, Karl Fischer, was strongly opposed to assimilation of the Wandervogel into the adult-supervised world of school and sport. Some of his lieutenants were more in favour of compromise.
