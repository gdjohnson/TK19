> It's the age old indie thing of displaying your ineptitude in the hope of seeming cute and vulnerable, like a wounded bird. Dress like a child. Have your toes pointing inward.

Cuteness is the “aestheticization of powerlessness,” “what we love because it submits to us”; suffering is the result and signal of this learned helplessness, calling out for the assistance of more powerful agents. «It is only in her suffering that the Young-Girl is lovable.»3
