# Servomechanisms
Servomechanisms, aka "servos," are automatic machines that use feedback to correct their actions, typically by way of a built-in encoder to ensure its outputs are achieving the desired effect.

The view of agents are servos is analogous to [[Karl Friston]]'s view of agents as [[predictive processing|prediction machines]] which make guesses, observe outcomes, and update their predictive models.

In [[Slava Gerovitch]], [[_From Newspeak to Cyberspeak - A History of Cybernetics_]]:

> [[people/Norbert Wiener|Wiener]] and Bigelow teamed up with the Mexican physiologist Arturo Rosenblueth, whom Wiener had met at a session of the Philosophy of Science Club, to explore the implications of the servomechanism analogy. They concluded that human voluntary activity was based on “circular processes, emerging from the nervous system into the muscles, and re-entering the nervous system through the sense organs.”... Wiener, Rosenblueth, and Bigelow came to view this circularity as a universal principle of purposeful behavior. They called it feedback, borrowing the term from control engineering. They interpreted any goal-directed action—from pointing a gun to picking up a pencil—as a negative feedback process in which the attempts to approach the goal were constantly corrected by return signals from the goal that indicated the current distance from its (anticipated) position, or “the amount by which we have failed to pick up the pencil at each instant.”

# Entropy and Life
Schrödinger's 1944 _What Is Life?_ argued that life is defined by its paradoxical stability and increasing structural complexity which disobeyed the "natural tendency of things to approach the chaotic state."

Of course, the [[second law of thermodynamics]] is true of _closed_ systems, and living organisms exist in open systems, thus there is no contradiction insofar as living organisms increase entropy elsewhere in the universe in order to keep entropy low within their own boundaries:

>  [[Ernest Schrödinger|Schrödinger]] interpreted the organism as a thermodynamic system that counteracted the inevitable increase of entropy by absorbing “negative entropy,” or “drinking orderliness,” from the environment.

In other words, they created "order from order," cannibalizing existing order to provide the energy needed to maintain its own order. 

> The fundamental divide thus lay not between living organisms and machines but between order and chaos. Both organisms and machines fought chaos with order, and by similar means: “order from order.”

> Schrödinger’s conceptual framework differed from [[Claude Shannon|Shannon]]’s in two important respects: Schrödinger interpreted codes as instruments of control, while Shannon viewed them as tools of communication; and Schrödinger interpreted entropy as a measure of disorder, while Shannon used it as a measure of uncertainty. On the basis of shared metaphors, however, biophysicists and communication engineers began to find a common language: cyberspeak.

# Human Communication as an Engineering Problem

> [[Norbert Wiener 1|Wiener]] and his collaborators became convinced that “the problems of control engineering and of communication engineering were inseparable.” The same conclusion was reached at about the same time by a group of control and communication engineers at the Bell Laboratories... Out of this juncture of control engineering and communication engineering emerged the idea of unity of control and communication—one of the theoretical underpinnings of cybernetics.

# The Making of Cyberspeak

> [In the view of cyberneticians,] humans and machines were two kinds of *control systems*, which, *operating* in certain *environment*, pursued their *goals* (hitting a *target*, increasing *order*, achieving better *organization*, or reaching the state of *equilibrium*) by *communicating* with this environment, that is, sending and receiving *information* about the results of their actions through *feedback*.

> Cyberspeak provided a set of concepts, which mediated between the worlds of living organisms and man-made artifacts and thus inextricably tied humans and machines together. Through cyberspeak, concepts could travel freely between mathematics, engineering, and biology.

> To borrow [[Peter Galison]]’s term, one might describe cybernetics as a trading zone, in which specialists from various fields could exchange ideas, experimental results, theories, and hypotheses
