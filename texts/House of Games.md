# Reason 2020: Economics Thinking

On exploitative communication:

> _House of Games_ (1987, David Mamet) setup: Margaret is a best-selling psychiatrist so overwhelmed by work, so frustrated by her helplessness to meaningfully improve her patients’ lives, that she enters a manic state, shows up in a pool hall across town and starts threatening a loanshark who is pressuring a patient of hers. It’s no coincidence that literal financial debts are the MacGuffin that makes this plot run. 
> 
> The loanshark, Mike, turns out to be more petty conman than gangster; Margaret’s intrigued. His bluffing and persuasion tactics sound like a great idea for her next bestseller. She asks him to show her his moves. It’s clear what she’s getting out of it—another book, excitement in her life, a model of masculine assertiveness. (Mike: “I think what draws you to me is this: I’m not afraid to examine the rules and to assert myself.”) But it’s not clear what _he’s_ getting out of it, and she never stops to ask. This is her first error. 
> 
> Mike takes her to a Western Union, pulls a con on a wholesome, off-duty marine who needs a bus ticket to Camp Pendleton. The con works by presenting false information—after all, values are hard to alter, but its priors that regulate action. At the last minute, when the marine’s practically begging Mike to take his money, Mike walks away, tells him to keep it. Remember Schelling small series of trust-building exchanges, “practice” for the real thing? Why would Mike skip on the money, he’s a criminal? Because he doesn’t want to _appear_ that way. He’s gaining _Margaret’s_ confidence. The marine’s not the mark. She is.
>
> Eventually and predictably, the bestselling psychiatrist gets scammed out of $80k in cash, believing, under false pretenses, that it’s a mob payoff—that the payment, in cash, handed over to Mike, will save her life. _How could she be so gullible?_ He told her what she wanted, then he gave it to her. She was getting everything she ever wanted. The real question is: Why _would_ she ask questions? 
>
> This is exploitative manipulation. It isn’t exploitative because he lied to her, or because his intentions were “bad.” It’s exploitative because their relationship took more from her than it delivered in turn, and because it was designed, deceptively, to do so. The final scene, where (spoilers) Margaret shoots Mike to death in an abandoned airport hanger, marks the end of their ongoing transaction—the part where they “settle up.” The final scenes show her so healthy and self-contented she’s practically glowing. She’s taken life into her own hands—asserted herself. It’s a comedy because it ends happy, and it ends happy because she walks away from it better than she started.

# Taylor 2009: Frames, Cons, and Double-Crosses, The Theatrical Cinema of David Mamet

On identity:

> The first crucial concept is that characters are entirely defined by, and exist solely in and through their actions: "The truth is, you never have to establish the character. In the first place, there is no such thing as character other than the habitual action, as Mr. Aristotle told us two thousand years ago. It just doesn't exist. Here or in Hollywood or otherwise. They always talk about the character out there in Hollywood, and the fact is, there is no such thing. It doesn't exist. The character is just habitual action. 'Character' is exactly what the person literally does in pursuit of the superobjective, the objective of the scene. The rest doesn't count."

On frames within frames:

> In _House of Games_, the con men give Margaret their confidence, the basis, as we later find out, of any successful con. So, what has happened is that the situational frame has shifted, it has been enlarged to reveal that the players are in fact a single group of confidence tricksters and that Margaret's role in the setting was not that of a distanced, uninvolved onlooker on the outside of the [[concepts/games|game]], but an integral and crucial part of a larger game in which she was to be the victim: from her point of view, the situation involved Mike and herself versus the guy from Las Vegas, with the other players more or less neutral, if sympathetic towards Mike; whereas in truth it was Mike and all the others against her. This constitutes a reversal of her usual position in her professional work with patients. The situational frame has shifted from what appeared to be an open game to a closed setting, i.e. the frame has been enlarged to encompass all of those present. The outside of the micro-game (poker) has been shown to be included in yet another bigger frame, a macro-game (the con). The narratological basis of this shiftiness of the situational frame is external focalization, i.e. a restricted range of knowledge, which in turn is based on restricted communicativeness, in which the film viewer in this case is placed in the same position as the innocent protagonist.

> To comprehend any [[concepts/games|game]], what is crucial of course is knowing where it begins and where it ends, a clear sense of what is inside the game and what is outside. By shifting the [[levelsOfAbstraction|frame reference]], however, the narration is deliberately simulating false borders and dissimulating the real ones; and, as Margaret will finally realize, the real con is a much larger one, which had already begun before she went to the "House of Games," the con game there and its subsequent revelation by the tricksters being itself a con in the service of an elaborate overarching plot to relieve her of 80,000 dollars of her own money

> [[concepts/games]] within games within games. The narrative mechanism of enlarging the [[levelsOfAbstraction|situational frame]] is a variation of what is known in art theory as _mise-en-abîme_, the play within the play, the image within the image, and of what Luhmann's sociological systems theory (borrowing the term from George Spencer Brown) calls _re-entry_. In principle, situational framing can be enlarged to the point of explicit self-reflexivity, to encompass the whole work. And in _House of Games_ it will be this mechanism of enlarging the frame which will be Mike's undoing in the final act. Because he has made the small mistake of hubris, of thinking himself to be the ultimate master of ceremonies, as though to demonstrate that he, too, is only a character within the writer-director's design, the master puller of strings being the author, Mamet punishes him in a final twist.

# The Last Psychiatrist 2013: The Dove Sketches Beauty Scam

> why didn't Mantegna take that guy's money at the end?  Why did he let him off the hook?  "He was just doing it as an example." Oh, like when a guy says he'll put in just the tip, "I want to see if it fits"?   It's not like the psychiatrist doesn't know he's a thief—that's why they were there in the first place. So he purposely didn't steal the money to make the psychiatrist feel at ease, feel closer to him.  To earn her confidence by first giving her his.  She's the mark.  The aborted short con is part of an unseen long con.

_No ground truth, only perceptions and narratives. You lose when your narratives gets you to give up advantages to the other player._

Billy Hahn, dissing Dr. Ford's writing and practice: "It's all talk—it's a con game." (Symmetric property of equality: all talk = con game, so a con = all talk.) This is her fear, a cousin of impostor syndrome: that she's just simulacra, that she's not "real." And when she cites this fear to her mentor, the mentor cannot even reassure her that their profession helps people—just that it's important to go through the motions. Billy sets up the self-doubt, and a desire to resolve it; then he offers her an opportunity to do just that: his life is in danger, and she can save him. She doesn't want his description of her to be true, she wants to prove—to herself, first and foremost—that she's "real," that she has agency, that she can help people. She agrees to help him if he gives her his gun; it's the first of many totems that act as reminders of the contracts between people.

Billiards table at House of Games: classic determinism metaphor.

Games w/in games, levels of game, different levels of terminal vs instrumental goals—the scam of the Sgt. is in service of the scam of Margaret

Selection games: in the opening poker scam scene, they're auditioning for her to choose them as book subjects

Feigned openness/vulnerability --> trust ("It's a con game not b/c they give you their confidence, but b/c you give them yours").

She unbuttons her blouse (strategy).

The con men have to exit at the end—leave the city, cut off contact with her—because of how hard it is to live longterm lies, practice longterm deception—it's just too constraining to maintain dissimulation/radically false [[opticratics|optics]]. ^5b8c83

He doesn't believe that she'll shoot him, so she nods toward her biography—"a little adventure would be nice"—to back up her status as a wildcard. She knows she can use it to back up her claim because that biographical feature is the basis by which they've designed a con on her—in other words, they know it's true because it "works."

The gun breaks the pattern of the entire movie, which is the ongoing manipulation of symbolic capital, tokens, representations—the transfer and excahnge of money/words/informations/beliefs. It's the first "real" thing, the first interruption of simulacra.

"Beg for your life," she tells him before killing him: she's showing him (proving to him?) the power of symbols. He won't do it, won't utter the words, won't submit. So he dies. +1pt for nurture, culture, memes.
