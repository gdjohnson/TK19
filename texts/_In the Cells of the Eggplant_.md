# Chapman: In the Cells of the Eggplant

## Chapter 1
### Are Eggplants Fruit?

> “Fruits are tasty.” Do you believe that, or not? It’s pretty clearly neither true nor false, so maybe it’s meaningless, as logical positivism recommended? It does seem to have some tenuous meaning… The problem is not so much that it’s meaningless as that it’s extremely indefinite. Which things count as “fruits”? Do you mean to include eggplants—technically berries—as fruits? Does “tasty” mean “tastes good” or “has some taste, not none?” (Is anything absolutely tasteless?) Tastes good according to whose liking? Does “are” imply “every single one,” or “generally speaking, but with some exceptions”?

> This is an extreme case, but all ordinary statements about eggplant-sized phenomena are also indefinite to some degree. What even counts as an eggplant? How about the various species of technically-eggplants that look and taste nothing like what you think of as one?1 Is a diced eggplant cooked with ground beef and tomato sauce still an eggplant? At exactly what point does a rotting eggplant cease to be an eggplant, and turn into “mush,” a different sort of thing? Are the inedible green sepals that are usually attached to the purple part of an eggplant in a supermarket—the “end cap,” we might say—also part of the eggplant? Where does an unpicked eggplant begin, and the eggplant bush it grows from end?

"Eggplant," then, is a term that covers millions of possible cases, and humans must use personal discretion and contextual inferences to determine the real subject of an eggplant-related utterance.

Attempts to make classifications and language more tractable, in a rationalist or positivist sense, typically involve some Carnapian explication of senses (e.g. fruit in the botanical sense, fruit in the culinary sense...) and an attempt to "hammer down" these senses of meaning into something non-nebulous. Such attempts run into several problems:

1. You typically discover a never-ending variety of weird exceptions, complications, and borderline cases. Is a glass bottle of poppy seeds “seed-bearing”? What is not a “structure”? Is a seedless banana a fruit? Is an eggplant still “part of an angiosperm” after it has been picked? (Does an entire object count as part of itself?) And what about the problems already encountered with cooked eggplants, rotting ones, and so forth?
2. The attempt often bogs down in taxonomizing an unbounded proliferation of “different senses,” which—as you repeatedly split them to deal with special cases—come to seem increasingly contrived, convoluted, and ad hoc. Dictionaries I consulted gave dozens of different definitions of “fruit,” with complicated relationships among them, all of them problematic in some way. “The developed ovary of a seed plant with its contents and accessory parts”: how developed does it have to be to count as a fruit? Which parts count as “accessories”? And “fruit” is quite well-behaved, as words go. The Oxford English Dictionary distinguishes 645 senses of “run.”
3. You find yourself trying to make one nebulous category (“fruit”) precise in terms of several others (such as “part”), which also turn out to be nebulous. Then you need to define those. You might think that eventually this process would terminate, that you would have covered the space of categories, that it would ground out in something solid; but in practice this never happens. The set of terms proliferates exponentially, and apparently endlessly.

The lessons, to Chapman, are a few—first, that absolute definitions are impossible _but unnecessary_: "We would need perfect clarity only if we needed absolute truth, but we don’t." 

> The function of language is not to express absolute truths. Usually, it is to get practical work done in a particular context. Statements are interpreted in specific situations, relative to specific purposes. Rather than trying to specify the exact boundaries of all the variants of a category for all time, we deal with particular cases as they come up. We use resources available in the context to make good-enough distinctions for action.

This view of language is fundamentally functional and therefore [[pragmatism|pragmatic]]. Echoing [[William James]], Chapman writes:

> Categorization serves practical purposes, so the underlying issue is not “is this absolutely and objectively an eggplant” but “can I make a decent moussaka from it?” Whether something counts as an eggplant [or rotted mush] (if it’s been in the refrigerator rather a long time) may depend on how badly you want moussaka. This is a main reason attempts at objective definition fail.

> This also explains the explosion of definitional “senses” [in attempts at explication]: they are attempts to specify in advance, in full generality, what will count as a member of the category in different contexts and for different purposes. Contexts and purposes are unenumerable, so this is impossible. In fact, we’ll see later that almost any word can mean almost anything, in some unusual context. This implies that analyzing words as having some enumerable set of “senses” can’t work.

Second, that the problem lies not merely in our map but in the territory, which is ontologically nebulous:

> We want terms to “carve nature at its joints,” but the eggplant-sized world has no joints. There is no natural, intrinsic, absolute distinction between eggplants and non-eggplants; nor can any specialized or technical subdivision of the category fully fix that.

The "true state" of the world is a collection of particle attributes; everything else is "rounding up," aggregation, and metaphor. There are no such things as "natural kinds":

> In philosophy, categories in the world that are absolute, intrinsic, or objective are called “natural kinds.” Pretty much the only available examples of natural kinds of eggplant-sized objects were biological species. Philosophers have reluctantly more-or-less accepted the recent factual discovery that species are necessarily nebulous, and that this makes the “natural kind” concept obsolete. 

In this frame, Plato's conceptual ideal (cutting nature at its joints) is impossible; nature doesn't _have_ joints. Formal logic requires ontological definiteness, but the ontology of the world is _indefinite_, nebulous:

> Earlier I asked “What sort of world would rationalism be true of?” It would be made of ontologically definite objects, categories, properties, and relationships. [...] There is a truth about which ontologically definite object something is, so either two are the same one, or different ones. There is a truth about whether some bit of matter is part of a definite object, or not. A definite object either is, or is not, a member of a definite category. An ontologically definite object has definite properties. They could be absolute (“is red”) or parameterized (“is 72% red”). What they can’t be is vague (“well, reddish I suppose”). Definite objects either do, or do not, stand in definite relationships with each other. The cat is on the mat, or it’s not.

## Chapter 2
### The purpose of meaning (is to get stuff done)

> We use words as tools to get things done; and to get things done, we improvise, making use of whatever materials are ready to hand. If you want to whack a piece of sheet metal to bend it, and don’t know or care what the “right” tool is (if there even is one), you might take a quick look around the garage, grab a large screwdriver at the “wrong” end, and hit the target with its hard rubber handle.
> 
> Words go the same way. Almost any word can be used to mean almost anything, in some context. You could play this as a challenge game… How about “The eggplant is a straw hat, and the spinach is yelling about politics.”
> 
> We’re in the kitchen of a vegetarian restaurant. A table’s entrees are ready, and the server who took the order is explaining to the one who will deliver the meal which diner gets which dish. One customer’s flamboyant straw hat is a salient, unambiguous identifying feature; you can see it all the way across the room. The other probably needs to turn up a hearing aid; you can hear their opinions about cultural appropriation all the way across the room.

### How We Refer

Chapman performs an "ethnomethodological flip" on the question of reference, looking at the concrete ways human being perform and sustain reference:

> We have to do the job that the correspondence theory attributed to metaphysical fairies. Reference is a task that we achieve with concrete work over time in a specific situation for a specific purpose.

Rather than a tidy formal system, these techniques of achieving reference are messy, ranging from "ungainly, amateurish kludges" to more established metonymy. "Referring is accomplished by whatever means is available, and improvised methods are unenumerable."

Relevance is a huge part of reference, and relevance is usually instrumental to a task at hand:

> Referring is possible only because the specificity of our purposes limit relevance. We don’t go around referring to arbitrary sets of atoms or random regions of spacetime. In everyday activity, we only want to refer to something because it’s relevant to our purposes. The way in which it is relevant usually provides adequate resources for referring.

> Referring is always context-dependent. This is a brute fact of physics. There is no absolute coordinate system, no (0, 0, 0) point to start from.

## Interlude: Ontological Remodeling
Ontological remodeling is a solution to nebulosity.

> Ontological remodeling—the reconfiguration of individuation criteria, categories, properties, and relationships

> There are various typical patterns for ontological change... One of the simplest and most common is replacing a binary opposition with a continuum.

Our categories are nebulous in the sense of being unified only by "family resemblance" ([[Wittgenstein]]), where there "is no single common feature, it’s just that this is similar to that, which is similar to another thing."

Chapman's factoring of "meta-rationality," and its treatment of categories (and the concept of truth) look basically [[pragmatism|pragmatic]]:

> Meta-rationality treats all categories as inherently purpose-laden—including scientific categories. It rejects the rationalist ideal of perfectly disinterested Truth.

> Once you recognize that denial of nebulosity is the deep structure underlying each of the difficulties rationalism encounters, the solution approach is obvious: accept nebulosity from the beginning, and work with it, instead of trying to ignore or eliminate it.

Meta-rationality attempts to synthesize formal systems rationality with sensibleness or "reasonableness":

> Reasonableness is not interested in universality. It aims to get practical work done in specific situations. Precise definitions and absolute truths are rarely necessary or helpful for that. Is this thing an eggplant? Depends on what you are trying to do with it. Is there water in the refrigerator? Well, what do you want it for? What counts as baldness, fruit, red, or water depends on your purposes, and on all sorts of details of the situation.

Like Sarah, he argues for a maintenance of _grounding_, or "correspondence":

> Sometimes a system can be made to work better by improving concrete practices for maintaining correspondences.

### Examples

#### Concepts that have been abandoned entirely

> categories like phlogiston, the luminiferous aether, and the Philosopher’s Stone turned out to have nothing in them, and got dropped. The taxon “Bestiae,” the Great Chain of Being, and the Hippocratic humors turned out to group genuine entities in useless ways, and so were also dropped.

#### Concepts which have been abandoned formally, but retain usefulness informally

> fire was an ontologically basic, formal category for thousands of years. After the Chemical Revolution of the 1700s, it dropped out of official scientific theory. It’s an ill-formed category, because there are too many marginal cases. Informally, it describes redox reactions within a nebulous range of rates and temperatures, in which the oxidizer is typically but not necessarily oxygen. An explosion is a too-fast redox reaction; rusting is too slow to count; fuel cell reactions run too cold. Burning sugar with sodium chlorate as the oxidizer sure looks like a fire, but should it count? On the other hand, although “fire” is no longer a formal category, the Chemical Revolution made it possible to understand combustion in general, and particular redox reactions, vastly better than before.

> “Species” was an ontologically basic, formal category in biology for thousands of years. Over the past few decades, better understanding of population dynamics has shown that it’s unavoidably nebulous. In general, there is no fact-of-the-matter about whether or not two individuals belong to the same species. However, as a consequence of that same remodeling, we understand speciation processes far better than when the category was taken to be well-defined.

> In 2006, the category “planet” disintegrated into absurdity. It got a new, official definition, which most everyone loathes and ignores. Discovery of numerous marginal cases made it clear that “planets” have nothing meaningfully in common. However, we understand individual planets far better than before. And, “planet” is still useful as a vague category in some contexts, so long as you realize there is no fact-of-the-matter about whether Pluto counts.
