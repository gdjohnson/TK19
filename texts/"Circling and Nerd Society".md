## Yarvin on worlding

> Here is a motivational-calendar thought for you: your connectedness to the world, and to reality, is measured in crowds, not friends. If you are in a true cult, your number is 1. The more crowds you are in, and the more different they are, the more perspectives of reality you have to be able to hold in your mind, to participate in all these crowds. And the more (reasonable) ways you have of observing reality, the saner you are.

> If you are in any situation where your crowd number is 1, you have only one social eye—only one shared way of observing the world. You have no parallax. If you are totally at home as a precious metals trader in the City of London, but never miss the Sturgis biker rally; while you spend a month every summer harpooning killer-whales as an honorary member of the Makah tribe, in the winter you teach ancient Greek and astrophysics at Stanford, while assisting CIA here and there… you have _mega_ parallax.

## Yarvin on narcissism

> When we ask human beings to tell their stories in a safe space where everyone who shares will feel heard, and no one at all will feel judged, we are creating a machine to nourish narcissism. We are asking people to _discover_ themselves—a hard problem. Instead they will _invent_ themselves—which is much easier. So what if the image and the reality diverge? All that matters is the image, anyway.

> The narcissist is a writer with an unfinished novel. He has a character, who is himself; his interpretations of the things he should have done, given the things that happened. Whatever happens in the future—if relevant, it will have to be written into the story.
