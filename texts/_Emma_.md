The book talks quite a bit about language, and communication, ambiguity and signals. The confusion between Emma and Elton; the word puzzles and letter-jumble games, the innuendoâ€”Elton believes he has made his interest utterly obvious, and is shocked Emma did not understand. (And Harriett believes Knightly is in love with her, and Emma believes Frank Churchhill is in love with her, it's the entire book.)
> "The post-office is a wonderful establishment!" said she. "The regularity and dispatch of it! If one thinks of all that it had to do, and all that it does so well, it is really astonishing!...So seldom that any negligence or blunder appears! So seldom that a letter, among the thousands that are constantly passing about the kingdom, is even carried wrong - and not one in a million, I suppose, actually lost! And when one considers the variety of hands, and of bad hands too, that are to be deciphered, it increases the wonder."
