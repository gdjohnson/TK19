One of the insights of the selection game is that evaluation is partially adversarial: candidate and evaluator are not goal-aligned; the candidate's interest lies in selection (passing the test) and the evaluator's in selecting the most capable candidate (successfully administering the test, and effectively screening candidates). Thus the evaluator must often be deceptive, must stay [[legibility|illegible]]. The nature of their tests must stay mysterious, to protect against cheap and degenerate play. They must often hide the very fact that a test is occurring, or mislead candidates as to their epistemic state, or the kind of responses which would constitute passing. Thus French's protagonist, Detective Ryan, writes of the job:

> [Truth] is the core of our careers, the endgame of every move we make, and we pursue it with strategies painstakingly constructed of lies and concealment and every variation on deception. The truth is the most desirable woman in the world and we are the most jealous lovers, reflexively denying anyone else the slightest glimpse of her... What we do is crude, crass and nasty. A girl gives her boyfriend an alibi for the evening when we suspect him of robbing a north-side Centra and stabbing the clerk. I flirt with her at first, telling her I can see why he would want to stay home when he's got her... Then I tell her we've found marked bills from the till in his classy white tracksuit bottoms, and he's claiming that she went out that evening and gave them to him when she got back. I do it so convincingly, with such delicate crosshatching of discomfort and compassion at her man's betrayal, that finally her faith in four shared years disintegrates like a sand castle and through tears and snot, while her man sits with my partner in the next interview room saying nothing except "Fuck off, I was home with Jackie," she tells me everything from the time he left the house to the details of his sexual shortcomings.

Of course, calling this a pursuit of truth is romanticizing what's actually be optimized for, which is a confession, a closed case. Because the detective is in a selection game—to keep his job, be promoted up, get better caseloads, better shifts, less gruntwork. He wants respect from his colleagues, his sergeant.

## Metonyms, types
> You learn by osmosis, as soon as you set your sights on the job, that you are expected to look professional, educated, discreetly expensive with just a soupçon of originality. We give the taxpayers their money's worth of comforting cliche. We mostly shop at Brown Thomas, during the sales, and occasionally come into work wearing embarrassingly identical soupçons. Up until then, the wackiest our squad had got was this cretin called Quigley, who... wore slogan T-shirts (_Mad Bastard_) under his suits because he thought he was being daring. When he eventually realied that none of us were shocked, or even remotely interested, he got his mammy to come up for the day and take him shopping at BT.

> I'm deeply suspicious of anything with a whiff of the New Age about it—not because of the practices themselves, which as far as I can tell from a safe distance may well have a lot to them, but because of the people who get involved, who always seem to be the kind who corner you at parties to explain how they discovered that they are survivors and deserve to be happy.

### Distinction
> All of the neighbors had made frantic little declarations of individuality via ferociously trimmed shrubs or geraniums or something, but the Devlins just mowed their lawn and left it at that, which in itself argued a certain level of originality.

## Everyday interaction (and detective work) as a game
> the little arts and negotiations of adulthood

> I do remember finally asking, "So how did you end up in the squad?" We had been talking about how she was settling in, and I thought I had dropped it in pretty casually, but she gave me a tiny, mischievous smile, as though we were playing checkers and she had caught me trying to distract her from a clumsy move. "Being a girl, you mean?" "Actually, I meant being so young," I said, although of course I had been thinking of both.

> "Are you OK?" Sophie asked me. "I'm fine," I said. "I just need coffee." The joy of the new hip, happening, double-espresso Dublin is that you can blame any strange mood on coffee deprivation.

But this line is not so much intended or bound to be a lie; it merely is truth indifferent. He needed an excuse so he came up with one. Thus, the performed line can actually turn out to be true:
> I still felt weird, light-headed, as though my eyes weren't focusing clearly enough to take in the image. _Maybe I really do need coffee_, I thought. 

The detectives are constantly deceptive:
> Cassie's mobile rang. "Oh for God's sake," she said, looking at the screen. "Hello sir... Hello? ...Sir? ...Bloody phones." She hung up. "Reception?" I said coldly. "The fucking reception is fine," she said. "He just wanted to know when we'd be back and what was taking us so long, and I didn't feel like talking to him."
> ...My mobile rang. "Ah, _fuck_, man," we both said, in unison. I did the bad-reception routine, and we spent the rest of the drive making a list of possible lines of inquiry. O'Kelly likes lists; a good one might distract him from the fact we hadn't rung him back.
> ...We sneaked in as quietly as we could... I shoved the file under my jacket, in case I ran into O'Kelly (there was no reason why I shouldn't have it, especially now that the link to the Devlin case was definite, but for some reason I felt guilty, furtive, as if I were absconding with some taboo artifact), and went back up to the squad room. Cassie was at her computer; she had left the lights off so O'Kelly wouldn't spot them.

> "And there's something odd about that family, sir," I said. This was my line; we had to get the point across, in case we ever needed a little leeway in investigating the Devlins, but if Cassie had said it O'Kelly would have gone off into a long snide boring routine about women's intuition. We were good at O'Kelly by this time. Our counterpoint has been polished to the seamlessness of a Beach Boys harmony—we can sense exactly when to swap the roles of front man and backup, good cop and bad copy, when my cool detachment needs to strike a balancing note of gravitas against Cassie's bright ease.

("in case we ever needed a little leeway in investigating the Devlins": There's this drive to [[empowerment]], to keep options open in the future, and we do real communicative work to open those options and keep them open)

> "How are you?" [I asked Heather.] "Oh, I'm all right," Heather said, pulling her pink fleece dressing gown more closely around herself. The martyred tone meant I had two options: I could say, "Great," and go into my room and close the door, in which case she would sulk and bang pans for days to register her displeasure at my lack of consideration, or I could say, "Are you OK?" in which case I would have to spend the next hour listening to a blow-by-blow account of the outrage perpetrated by her boss or her sinuses or whatever it was that was currently making her feel hard done by. Fortunately I have an Option C, though it has to be saved for emergencies. "Are you sure?" I said. "There's this awful flu going around at work, and I think I'm coming down with it. I hope you don't get it too."

(Sure, strategic interaction, but check out that frequency dependent selection.)

> Cooper took his time thinking about it, to punish her for interrupting. Finally he shook his head judiciously.

Clifton: We never do anything by accident...

> I went into the kitchen and started making myself a sandwich, ham and Heather’s low-fat cheese—I’d forgotten to go shopping... “Oh shit,” I said aloud. The Kavanagh case... I’d promptly managed to forget all about it. “What’s wrong?” Heather piped eagerly, hurrying out of the sitting room at the prospect of an opening for conversation. I threw the cheese back into the fridge and slammed the door on it, not that that would do much good: Heather knows to a millimeter how much of everything she has left, and once sulked till I bought her a new bar of fancy organic soap because I’d come in drunk and washed my hands with hers.

> I gave [O'Kelly] the migraine story. The one joy of migraines is that they make a perfect excuse: they're disabling, they're not your fault, they can last as long as you need them to and nobody can prove you don't have one. And I really did look sick. O'Kelly made a few derisive comments about headaches being "womany shite" but I regained a little of his respect by bravely insisting on staying in work.

> I sent Cassie a text saying I wasn't feeling well enough for dinner at her place; I couldn't bear the thought of all that solicitous tact. I left work just in time to get home before Heather—she "does her Pilates" on Monday evenings—[and] wrote her a note saying I had a migraine and locked myself in my room. 

Cassie flatters Mrs. Fitzgerald in interview, with some futures forecasting from Ryan at the end of the excerpt:
> "Could I take another scone, Mrs. Fitzgerald? These are the nicest ones I've had in ages." They were the only ones she'd had in ages. She dislikes scones on the grounds that they "don't taste like food."
> 
> [...]
> 
> Cassie made a flatteringly big deal of choosing her scone, took a huge bite and said, "Mmm." If she ate enough of them that Mrs. Fitzgerald felt the need to go heat up more, I was going to brain her.

> "Mrs. Sandra Scully?" I said. She nodded warily. I saw her peg us as cops, well before our IDs were out, and get ready to go on the defensive... "I'm Detective Ryan, and this is Detective Maddox. She'd like to speak with you for a few minutes." I felt Cassie shift almost impercetibly beside me, clocking the signal. If I hadn't been sure, I would have said "we," and we would both have gone through the routine Katy Devlin questions with her until I made up my mind [whether this was the Sandra we were after]. But I was sure, and Sandra was likely to be more comfortable talking about [her assault] without a guy in the room.

> It was on the tip of my tongue: _Those kids, weren't they spying on you that day? Weren't you worried they would tell?_ But the detective in me held me back. I knew I would only get one chance, and I needed to come to it on my own territory and with all the ammunition I could bring.

### Short-termism and long-termism in coordination games

Damien Donnelly makes up a story about a creep in a tracksuit hanging out near the archaeological site. Detective Ryan thinks it sounds made-up, says:
> You get people like this in every investigation, people who end up wasting huge amounts of your time with their compulsion to say whatever they think you want to hear.

Of course, he's wrong about certain levels of his interpretation—it is made up, but to throw him off the scent rather than people-please. 

## Opticratics
Cassie on getting falsey accused by a psychopath:
> "It's ironic, isn't it? A hundred psychology students, and not one of us recognized a classic psychopath. You know the strange thing? I wished I had done everything he claimed I had. If I had, then it would all have made sense: I would have been getting what I deserved. But I hadn't done any of it, and yet that made absolutely no difference to what happened. There was no such thing as cause and effect. I though I was losing my mind."

## Character work
> "Come on," I said, "Let's get back into character. " Cassie put out her smoke on the sole of her shoe and tucked the butt back into the packet, and we headed across the road. 

> I sometimes thought the brass assumed I was a good detective in the mindless preprogrammed way that some men will assume a tall, slim, blond woman is beautiful even if she has a face like a hyperthyroid turkey: because I have all the accessories. I have a perfect BBC accent, picked up at boarding school as protective camouflage, and all that colonization takes awhile to wear off: even though the Irish will cheer for absolutely any team playing against England, and I know a number of pubs where I couldn't order a drink without risking a glass to the back of the head, they still assume that anyone with a stiff upper lip is more intleligent, better educated and generally more likely to be right. On top of this I am tall, with a bony, rangy build that can look lean and elegant if my suit is cut just right, and fairly good-looking in an offbeat way. Central Casting would definitely think I was a good detective, probably the brilliant maverick loner who risks his neck fearlessly and always gets his man.

> I felt that this had been an excellent decision... I suppose it felt, at the time, like the kind of thing that enigmatic Central Casting maverick would have done.

Outside appearances can calm and assure even those who are putting them on:
> I thought of how we must look to [the young trainees]: how much older, how aloof, how much more confident in the little arts and negotiations of adulthood. It steaded me somehow, the image of two Murder detectives with their practiced faces giving away nothing...

## Misleading appearances, surprising realities
> Sophie is my favorite crime-scene tech. She is slim and dark and demure, and on her the white shower cap looks like she should be bending over wounded soldiers' beds with cannon fire in the background, murmuring something soothing and giving out sips of water from a canteen. In actual fact, she is quick and impatient and can put anyone from superintendents to prosecutors in their place with a few crisp words. I like incongruity.

> One [tree] had a broken piece of blue plastic rope heavily knotted around a high branch, a couple of feet dangling. It was frayed and mildewed and implied sinister Gothic history—lynch mobs, midnight suicides—but I knew what it was. It was the remnant of a tire swing.

## World flavor
> When I made the Murder squad, I had already had my new work clothes—beautifully cut suits in materials so fine they felt alive to your fingers, shirts with the subtlest of blue or green pinstripes, rabbit-soft cashmere scarves—hanging in my wardrobe for almost a year. I love the unspoke dress code. It was one of the things taht first fascinated me about the job—that and the private, functional, elliptical shorthand: latents, trace, Forensics... "Pull in the ma first, then give him an hour or two to sit at home worrying about what she's saying, then get him back in." ...It was these arcana I craved, these near-invisible textures like a Braille legible only to the initiated.


## Signifying boundaries
> "...we'd like to speak to the person who found the body. The others can go back to work, as long as they stay outside the boundaries of the crime scene. We'll speak with them later."
> "How will... Is there something to show where it—where they shouldn't be?"
> "...There's crime-scene tape in place," I said. "If they stay outside it, they'll be fine."


## Generalized reading
> "As you know, the body of a young girl was found on this site earlier today." One of the guys let his breath out in a little burst and caught it again. He was in a corner, sandwiched protectively between two of the girls, clutching a big steaming mug in both hands; he had short brown curls and a frank, freckled boy-band face. I was pretty sure this was Damien Donnelly. The others seemed subdued (except for Sculptor Boy) but not traumatized, but he was white under the freckles and holding the mug way too hard.

> "[Rosalind] dresses funny, she wears too much makeup." "She's well groomed, so there's something wrong with her?" "Please, Ryan, do us both a favor and grow up; you know exactly what I mean. She smiles at inappropriate times, and, as you spotted, she wasn't wearing a bra." I had noticed that, but I hadn't realized that Cassie had as well, and the dig irritated me. "She may well be a very *nice girl*, but there's something off there."

> Sam appears blithely unaware of subtext and emotional cross-currents, but I sometimes wonder if anyone can be quite as oblivious as all that.
