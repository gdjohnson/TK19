## Scorekeeping in baseball

In baseball, there are specifications for the mechanics (or "kinematics") of scoring (which player behaviors have which effects on score), and specifications for correct play (a list of imperatives and specifications of incorrect play). Further, players play under a directive to play correctly and advance the score in a particular direction. The former specifications are something like "constitutive rules"—definitional to the game as game, they constitute the "score function" by which scorekeeping operates. The latter directives are something like "regulative rules," normative admonishments. Score specifications reflect a (lossy) compression of previous play; play specifications define the symbolic (by-the-letter) space of possibles for current play.

An alternative analysis of baseball, equivalent to "operationalism or legal realism," claims that "the score is, by definition, whatever some scoreboard says it is."

> On any such view, the specifications of the kinematics of score have a changed status. No longer are they constitutive rules akin to definitions. Rather, they are empirical generalizations, subject to exceptions, about the ways in which the players' behavior tends to cause changes on the authoritative scoreboard. 

Conversations can similarly be approached or conceptualized either way. The scoreboard is something like participants' mental representations, or their feelings about the outcomes of the interaction.

However, conversations have _rules of accommodation_ that change the dynamics of play, and the relationship of players to rules. By _rules of accommodation_, Lewis is capturing the way that listeners often—before they assume the utterance is nonsensical or false—will put work in to actively accommodate and make sense of speaker utterances, so as to determine intended meaning, make necessary inferences, alter previous assumptions, etc.

## Rule of accomodation for presupposition
> If at a time _t_ something is said that requires presupposition _P_ to be acceptable, and if _P_ is not presupposed just before _t_ then—_ceteris paribus_ and within certain limits—presupposition _P_ comes into existence at _t_.

For instance, if I say "John's children are asleep," it presupposes that John has children, and this state of affairs does not need re-stating.

## Rule of accomodation for permissibility
> At any stage in the enslavement, there is a boundary between some courses of action for the slave that are permissible, and others that are not. The range of permissible conduct may expand or contract. The master shifts the boundary by saying things to the slave. Since the slave does his best to see to it that his course of action is a permissible one, the master can control the slave by controlling what is permissible. 

## Rule of accomodation for comparative salience
> If at time _t_ something is said that requires, if it is to be acceptable, that _x_ be more salient than _y_; and if, just before _t_, _x_ is no more salient than _y_; then—ceteris paribus and within certain limits—at _t_, _x_ becomes more salient than _y_.

That is, before assuming that a speaker is saying something false or nonsensical, the listener will "make sense of" or "make the utterance work" by making _x_ (previously an indirect object, for instance) the subject of the following utterance.
