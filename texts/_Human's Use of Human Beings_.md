## Communication and control

> In giving the definition of cybernetics in the original book, I class [[communication]] and control together. Why did I do this? When I communicate with another person, I impart a message to him, and when he communicates back with me he returns a related message which contains information primarily accessible to him and not to me. When I control the actions of another person, I communicate a message to him, and although this message is in the imperative mood, the technique of communication does not differ from that of a message of fact. Furthermore, if my control is to be effective I must take cognizance of any messages from him which may indicate that the order is understood and has been obeyed.'

> The commands through which we exercise our control over our environment are a kind of information which we impart to it.

> In control and communication we are always fighting nature's tendency to degrade the organized and to destroy the meaningful; the tendency, as Gibbs has shown us, for entropy to increase.

> Man is immersed in a world which he perceives through his sense organs. Information that he receives is co-ordinated through his brain and nervous system until, after the proper process of storage, collation, and selection, it emerges through effector organs, generally his muscles. These in turn act on the external world, and also react on the central nervous system through receptor organs such as the end organs of kinaesthesia; and the information received by the kinaesthetic organs is combined with his already accumulated store of information to influence future action.

> Information is a name for the content of what is exchagned with the outer world as we adjust to it, and make our adjustment felt on it.

> To live effectively is to live with adequate information.

> Messages are themselves a form of pattern and organization.

> the more probable the message, the less information it gives [adds]

> control of a machine on the basis of its _actual_ performance rather than its _expected_ performance is known as feedback

## Leibnitz and optics
> Leibnitz... saw the whole world as a collection of beings called "monads" whose activity consisted in the perception of one another on the basis of a pre-established harmony laid down by God, and it is fairly clear that he thought of this interaction largely in optical terms.

> Leibnitz, dominated by ideas of communication, is, in more than one way, the intellectual ancestor of the ideas of this book, for he was also interested in machine computatino and in automata.

> For our purposes, the important thing is that in Einstein's work, light and matter are on an equal basis, as they had been in the writings before Newton

> Gibb's work... is probabilistic from the very start, yet both directions of work represent a shift in the point of view of physics in which the world as it actually exists is replaced ins ome sense or other by the world as it happens to be observed, and the old naive realism of physics gives way to something on which Bishop Berkeley might have smiled with pleasure.

## Communicating with kittens

> I call to the kitten and it looks up. I have sent it a message which it has received by its sensory organs and which it registers in action. The kitten is hungry and lets out a pitiful wail. This time it is the sender of a message. The kitten bats at a swinging spool. The spool swings to its left, and the kitten catches it with its left paw. This time messages of a very complicated nature are both sent and received within the kitten's own nervous system through certain nerve end-bodies in its joints, muscles, and tendons; and by means of nervous messages sent by these organs, the animal is aware of the actual position and tensions of its tissues. It is only through these organs that anything like a manual skill is possible.

> If I pick up my cigar, I do not will to move any specific muscles. Indeed in many cases I do not know what those muscles are. What I do is to turn into action a certain feedback mechanism; namely, a reflex in which the amount by which I have yet failed to pick up my cigar is turned into a new and increased order to the lagging muscles, whichever they may be.
