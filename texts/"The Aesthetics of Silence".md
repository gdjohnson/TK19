# Sontag 1967: The Aesthetics of Silence (Aspen 5)

_The scene changes to an empty room. Rimbaud has gone to Abyssinia to make his fortune in the slave trade. Wittgenstein has first chosen schoolteaching, then menial work as a hospital orderly. Duchamp has turned to [[chess]]. And, accompanying these exemplary renunciations of a vocation, each man has declared that he considers his previous achievements in poetry, philosophy, or art as trifling, of no importance._

The aesthetics of silence, to Sontag, is our culture's rediscovery (or "reinvention") of the spiritual (which is to say, "plans, terminologies, ideas of deportment aimed at the resolution of painful structural contradictions inherent in the human situation, at the completion of human consciousness, at transcendence"):

> Behind the appeals for silence lies the wish for a perceptual and cultural clean slate. And, in its most hortatory and ambitious version, the advocacy of silence expresses a mythic project of total liberation. What's envisaged is nothing less than the liberation of the artist from himself, of art from the particular art work, of art from history, of spirit from matter, of the mind from its perceptual and intellectual limitations.

> In the modern era, one of the most active metaphors for the spiritual project is "art." The activities of the painter, the musician, the poet, the dancer et al, once they were grouped together under that generic name (a relatively recent move), have proved to be a peculiarly adaptable site on which to stage the formal dramas besetting consciousness, each individual work of art being a more or less astute paradigm for regulating or reconciling these contradictions. Of course, the site needs continual refurbishing. Whatever goal is set for art eventually proves restrictive, matched against the widest goals of consciousness. Art, itself a form of mystification, endures a succession of crises of demystification; older artistic goals are assailed and, ostensibly, replaced; outgrown maps of consciousness are redrawn. But what supplies all these crises with their energy — an energy held in common, so to speak — is the very unification of numerous, quite disparate activities into a single genus. At the moment at which "art" comes into being, the modern period of art begins. From then forward, any of the activities therein subsumed becomes a profoundly problematic activity, each of whose procedures and, ultimately, whose very right to exist, can be called into question.

> the choice of permanent silence doesn't negate [Duchamp/Rimbaud/Wittgenstein's] work. On the contrary, it imparts retroactively an added power and authority to what was broken off; disavowal of the work becoming a new source of its validity, a certificate of unchallengeable seriousness.

Silence is part of the "ambivalence about making contact with the audience which is a leading motif of modern art, with its tireless commitment" to the esoteric.

Art's incessant self-questioning, its deconstruction of its own meaning, was never followed by a building-back-up; only the questions remain, and "no bird has the heart to sing in a thicket of questions" (René Char, quot. by Sontag).

> The newer myth, derived from a post-psychological conception of consciousness, installs within the activity of art many of the paradoxes involved in attaining an absolute state of being described by the great religious mystics. As the activity of the mystic must end in a via negative, a theology of God's absence, a craving for the cloud of unknowingness beyond knowledge and for the silence beyond speech, so art must tend toward anti-art, the elimination of the "subject" (the "object," the "image"), the substitution of chance for [[intent|intention]], and the pursuit of silence.

In other words, art, having grown tired of itself and its novelty [[treadmill]] of decadence, has self-consigned itself, resolved to a false fate on the inkling of stagnation, that the "end" of art is nigh. An _Ubik_-style halflife results, not dead, not living, no one trying to revive it.

We can also understand silence as a move in a game, a way of elevating oneself above art's corpse through its renunciation:

> formerly, the artist's good was mastery of and fulfillment in his art. Now it's suggested that the highest good for the artist is to reach that point where those goals of excellence become insignificant to him, emotionally and ethically, and he is more satisfied by being silent than by finding a voice in art. Silence in this sense, as termination, proposes a mood of ultimacy antithetical to the mood informing the self-conscious artist's traditional serious use of silence: as a zone of meditation, preparation for spiritual ripening, an ordeal which ends in gaining the right to speak.

> after the artist has demonstrated that he possesses genius and exercised that genius authoritatively, [and having] already surpassed his peers, by the standards which he acknowledges, pride has only one place left to go. For, to be a victim of the craving for silence is to be, in still a further sense, superior to everyone else.

Even within the formal game, silence is a move:

> A genuine emptiness, a pure silence, are not feasible—either conceptually or in fact. If only because the art-work exists in a world furnished with many other things, the artist who creates silence or emptiness must produce something dialectical:  a full void, an enriching emptiness, a resonating or eloquent silence. Silence remains, inescapably, a form of speech (in many instances, of complaint or indictment) and an element in a dialogue.

But since true silence is impossible, since audience expectation ensures a response, we find only "various moves in the direction of an ever-receding horizon of silence—moves which, by definition, can't ever be fully consumated." 

> To look at something that's "empty" is still to be looking, still to be seeing something—if only the ghosts of one's own [[predictive hermeneutics|expectations]].

# Quietism

Quietism is a name given (by its opponents) to a late 17th C Christian philosophy, spearheaded by Miguel de Molinos, that emphasized contemplation, stillness, passivity, mysticism, and spiritual growth. It had parallels to gnosticism, stoicism, and epicureanism.

In the 20th C, a school of analytic philosophy arose which saw philosophy as fundamentally therapeutic. From the Oxford Encyclopedia entry:

> Quietism in contemporary analytic philosophy is the view or stance that entails avoidance of substantive philosophical theorizing and is usually associated with certain forms of skepticism, pragmatism, and minimalism about truth. More particularly, it is opposed to putting forth positive theses and developing constructive arguments.

This school was named after the theological tradition, noting especially the "Pyrrhonian skeptics of the Hellenistic period, who pursued imperturbability, quietude or tranquility of mind (ataraxia) through suspension of judgment (epoché) and refused assent (synkatathesis) to any philosophical thesis" (Oxford Enc).
