> The rules of a finite game are the contractual terms by which the players can agree who won.

> Finite players play within boundaries; infinite players play with boundaries.

> We are playful when we engage others at the level of choice, when there is no telling in advance where our relationship will come outâ€”when, in fact, no one has an outcome to be imposed on the relationship, apart from the decision to continue it.

> When we are playful with each other, we relate as free persons, and the relationship is open to surprise; _everything_ that happens is of consequence. It is, in fact, seriousness that closes itself to consequence, for seriousness is a dread of the unpredictable... To be serious is to press for a specified conclusion.

Finite players play for power:

> It is the desire of all finite players to be Master Players, to be so perfectly skilled in their play that nothing can surprise them, so perfectly trained that every move in the game is foreseen at the beginning.

> Death in life is a mode of existence in which one has ceased all play; there is no further striving for titles.

> Life in death concerns those who are titled and whose titles, since they are timeless, may not be extinguished by death.

> Where a society is defined by its boundaries, [culture plays _with_ boundaries,] is defined by its horizon.

> Sexuality is the only finite game in which the winner's prize is the defeated opponent... The seduced opponent is so displayed as to draw public attention to the seducer's triumph.

> World exists in the form of audience.

> Because the seriousness of finite play derives from the players' need to correct another's putative assessment of themselves... finite players become their own hostile observers in the very act of competing.

> the reduction of an unpredictable vitality to a predictable mass, the transformation of the remote into the familiar. It is to rid oneself of the need to attent otherness.

> Infinite speech is therefore not _about_ anything, [but] always _to_ someone.

> I can explain nothing to you unless I first draw your attention to patent inadequacies in your knowledge: discontinuities in the relations between objects, or the presence of anomalies you cannot account for by any of the laws known to you.
