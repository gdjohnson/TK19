Think the thesis of _White Lotus_ is something like, "[[Power]] is having things people want," and how power is subtler and more pernicious, more deeply woven into social fabric, than people sometimes think. The other thesis is that people are still animals which—I've never noticed before but it's crazy how "people are animals" is basically advancing en evpsych worldview—everything is sex, hierarchy, power—but without the baggage. Remember how eugenics used to be a progressive issue? wonder if there was an alternate timeline where evpsych was owned by the left, and people were rocking their Foucauldian readings of runaway selection. Bateson's cybernetic and autopoietic model's more interesting than Foucault's anyway.

Powerful people's outsized purchasing power gives them control over other people, which is often consensual (power enforced by carrots, rather than sticks) but results in those who accept the bargain degraded/less for taking.

In the contemporary world (“neoliberalism”), power is less about stick and more about carrot.

There’s something deeply sad and true about Quin wearing an “End Homelessness” shirt as he turns down the outrigger canoers—"I would just slow you down.“ He’s desperate for community, belonging, and causes are a way to plug in to the social matrix.

Watch the trailer, see if you know what _White Lotus_ is about. Tip: You gotta piece together the vibes instead of looking for plot. Here's what the trailer shows us: wealthy white families, hypochondria (psychosomatic issues), status maneuvering, power relations between the black masseuse/spa therapist and her wealthy client, inappropriate boundary violations (the Dad telling his kids about the swollen testicles; the lady asking her masseuse to dinner). Wealthy white people being assholes. Politics of the service industry. Possessiveness, ownership, the way the wealthy and powerful are literally selected for possessiveness and ownership and grabbing things, taking things, using their power to keep control of other people.

Once the structural conditions are in place, the plot becomes obvious: The wealthy, white, powerful people will come in, make a mess, make their problem everyone else's, mess up the lives of the powerless service workers. Then they'll figure out how to get their happy ending—using power—and waltz into the sunset, leaving the mess they've made behind them.
