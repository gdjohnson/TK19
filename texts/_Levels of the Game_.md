> Johnson always told the Junior Development Team that the first point played in any set was of considerable psychological importance. A perceptible edge can go to the winner of that point. As the case may be, that one point can restore, maintain, deflate, or destroy confidence. Confidence goes back and forth across a tennis net much like the ball itself, and only somewhat less frequently. If two players are on about the same level, no matter what that level is, the player who experiences more minutes of confidence will be the winner.
        
> One day [as a young boy], when [Ashe] was playing someone his own age, he kept looking around after he hit good shots, to see who might be watching. [His coach] bawled him out for it. [He] told him if he continued to do anything like that [he] wasn't gonna be bothered with [coaching] him anymore.
    
> Players who are new to the Junior Development Team swing broom handles at the Tom Stow Stroke Developer until they can connect consistently with the ball and not the cord. Then they take their broom handles to the court and use them instead of racquets. Dr. Johnson calls this "learning how to _see_ the ball." When they can play proficiently with the broom handles, actually rallying, they are advanced to the use of strung frames.
    
> If Dr. Johnson told Arthur [Ashe] to hit to an opponent's backhand and nowhere else, Arthur would hit to the backhand even if the other player edges over so far that ninety per cent of the court was on his forehand side. "Whatever strategy you gave him to play, he wouldn't change to save his life," Dr Johnson says. "He did what you told him, even if he lost at it."
    
> Graebner looks at [his wife and professional women's player] Carole about a hundred times a match... Now, at Forest Hills, she raises one hand and makes a patting motion, as if she were soothing an invisible horse. This signal means "Calm down." If she raises two clenched fists, it means "Come on, now. Get your second wind. This is a big point." If she puts one hand on top of her head and shakes her head, it means "Unbelievable!"—or, in translation, "Good shot."

> Ashe is thinking, "Graebner just looked at his wife." And behind Arthur's impassive face—behind the enigmatic glasses, the lifted chin, the first-mate-on-the-bridge look—there seems to be a smile. Progress against Graebner in any given match, many players believe, can be measured directly by the number of times Graebner has looked at his wife.

> Ashe may not have quite Graebner's power, but his serves—in the vernacular of the game—move better than Graebner's do. They follow less predictable patterns, and they come off the grass in less expectable ways.
    
> When Clark moves with correct anticipation to cover a shot, Dr. Graebner says, "He read that well"
