# Hendrik Vollmer 2013: What kind of game is everyday interaction?

Everyday interaction, most substantially, can be described as "a game of tacit coordination among players maintaining expectations." 

> ...the "effective cooperation in maintaining expectations" pictured by [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] (1983) is associated not only with the overall stability of the "interaction order," but also with questions of individual and collective efficiency, and with persistent inequalities sustained among participants of everyday interaction.

Vollmer presents a picture of Garfinkel and [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]]'s 1960s work as missing the ball on the true nature of tacit coordination and mixed-motive games—misunderstanding Schelling's work by taking the overly narrow view of games that had dominated [[game theory]] previous to Schelling. He cites contemporary authors, like James Coleman (1968) and [[Jessie Bernard]] (1965), as predicting that a "social-interactionist school" defined by the "convergence between [[game theory]] and sociology with [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] and Schelling as 'the meeting point'"—and yet, such a convergence was "left unexplored by [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]], and since by many other students of everyday interaction." 

## The tacit nature of everyday coordination

The crucial insight of [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] and Garfinkel is that coordination is performed tacitly: "participants go along with events and activities but do not explicitly negotiate what it is they are going along with.... participants rarely, if ever, disclose their interests, motives, preferences, or utilities explicitly in the coordination of expectations: participants may talk a great deal about all sorts of things but, as Garfinkel's famous breaching experiments (1967) very effectively demonstrate, they generally do not like to talk about what they are talking about."

Coordination games are often characterized by "payoff distributions in which players are rewarded for making moves that in some sense match," e.g. the battle of the sexes, or stag hunting, or even a [[game theory|prisoner's dilemma]]. Because humans are skilled at mirroring, mimicry, and social learning, some of the best-accessible equilibria those in which a joining player, by copying existing players' practices, will enter into an equilibrium. This has been called by Ken Binmore "Nash's categorical imperative": to "adopt strategies that will lead to equilibrium selection if they are adopted by others" (Vollmer 2013).

(Other types of coordination games reach their most efficient equilibria through "complementary rather than identical moves," in the spirit of "a division of labor.")

How do members learn to tacitly coordinate, and maintain congenial expectations? Through an "attunement" to one anothers "full bodily and somatic presence," subtle cues of affirmation, surprise, confusion, disappointment, etc. (The "surprising ability of humans to read each other" [Pentland 2008] and perform face-work, as explored by Rochat, Tomasello and many other thinkers.)

> Learning emerges from tacit coordination because, very generally speaking, the confirmation of expectations is pleasant and the frustration of expectations is unpleasant. Powerful emotions such as shame and embarrassment are involved in acquiring socially appropriate expectations and respective preferences. Rather than a list of verbally formulated expectations or definitions of situations that players would memorize, the general result is a habitualized feeling of appropriateness (Bourdieu 1990). Tacit coordination, by virtue of of keeping appropriateness mostly implicit rather than making it an issue of conversation, will tend to result in knowledge that is common among participants but at the same time to a large extent tacit.

This is the famous "taken-for-grantedness of sociality reality that is at the centre of the famous essay by Berger and Luckmann ([_The Social Construction of Reality_] 1966)." 

Given this tacit nature, and the principle of affirmations, we should expect an abundance of inefficient or Pareto-dominated equilibria:

> Since the less efficient outcome is still better than other outcomes that a player could achieve given the other player's choices, Pareto-dominated coordination equilibria will often be stable Nash equilibria—breaking down only if both players simultaneously switched to the more favourable coordination equilibrium.

That is, we should expect situations in which Pareto improvement is possible—or, in other words, we are often stuck on local maxima, with higher peaks reachable only by a coordinated switch. "Given that coordination is tacit, not only will by definition any first move away from a given equilibrium imply a loss of utility, but also players cannot be certain that an alternative equilibrium will even exist." We might call this a leap of faith—you leave one equilibrium and model another, taking a personal utility loss (from the forfeited coordination) and hoping that others will join  you, for an eventual, collective utility gain. In this frame, we can see disagreeableness as helping dicover better equilibria, and agreeableness as helping settle at all. There may even be evolutionary superior distributions, in a population, of agreeable or disagreeable personalities; these personality inclinations can to some extent be considered "strategic," and might emerge or be exacerbated by environmental requirements or niche occupation. 

What are the benefits of tacit coordination? For one, the endless "et cetera clause" specification of [[spirit vs letter|spirit into letter]] is a logistical nightmare. Tacit expectations also provide leeway or maneuvering room for participants on both sides of a tacit "contract." Further,

> The strongest case for principles of affirmation as efficient orientations for gaining utility from maintaining expectations though may perhaps be provided by the observation that, while the confirmation of expectations may sometimes be a private affair of checking ideas and sometimes an institutional affair of applying collectively ratified rules, the utility gained from entertaining them appears to be particularly high if they are collectively ratified among co-present participants. This observation is central to Randall Collins' Neo-Durkheimian understanding of interaction ritual as a process in which the entrainment of participants into patterns of physical interaction with a mutual focus is in itself rewarding, and a superior source of emotional energy.

Here, it is [[ritual]] "solidarity" and [[alignment]] themselves which become the object, and utility payoff, of the tacit game of ritual "in which participants attune to another's faces, eyes, gestures, limbs, and very minute details of their encounter in coordinating expectations."

## The emergence of conventionalism

> ...a likely outcome of the repeated run of tacit coordination games within a collective [is] that certain solutions to coordination problems are learned thoroughly and become routines which, at the same time, remain to some extent tacit, beyond reflection or deliberate modification. 

This repeated run of tacit coordination problems leads to a construction of norms, or [[social reality]]. Individuals in a community "train" one another socially, and settle on "focal points that become conventional." Schelling 1960:

> The force of many rules of etiquette and social restrain, including some (like the rule against ending a sentence with a proposition) that have been divested of their relevance and authority, seems to depend on their having become "solutions" to a coordination game: everyone expects everyone to expect everyone to expect observance, so that nonobservance carries the pain of conspicuousness.

This, as Schelling notes, helps maintain an organizational culture over its Ship-of-Theseus lifespan. Just as the planks of the ship, one-by-one replaced, are fitted into the holes and structure of the whole, the system of norms inducts new members into its logic; these new members go on, once trained, to uphold many of the same norms and values as previous generations' members.

Further, Vollmer notes, strategic situations are experienced as "stressful, risky, and forbidding" for many players involved. Conventional [[ritual|rituals]] and agreements, which can become taboo (i.e. reputationally damaging) to break in favor, are one way of lowering the cognitive and temporal overhead of doing business.

## Exile vs belonging

> the repeated run of tacit coordination within a collective will favour a distribution of expectations that makes defection less likely by segregating populations into cooperators and defectors.

Here we see much of the role of "coordinative credit" and reputational systems of vouching, or symbolic [[capital]]. We also have a justification for systems of imprisonment or exile. 

Societies in which defection is few and far between can be considered high-trust societies, and are able to coordinate more effectively to greater collective utility. 

> learning will over time cluster participants who are able to confirm each other's expectations, establishing segments in a collective in which tacit cooperation can be run in a manner allowing for some fluctuation as long as participants are drawn from the same segment... conventions can arise that are universal within the segment.

This further promises that "more deliberate forms of coordination that rely on the relative predictability of expectations and activities become available within the segment by virtue of the mere fact of stimulus generalization: by reliably motivating specific moves, certain stimuli acquire the quality of [[signaling theory|signals]], and thus present additional leverage for coordination."

## The Simon and Garfinkel principle

Randall Collins (2004) calls "the tendency among participants to do 'being ordinary'" (Vollmer 2013) the Simon & Garfinkel principle, after Herbert Simon's "principle of affirmation" and Garfinkel's finding that "the most important 'ethnomethods' are to avoid raising questions," and to assume the normalcy of appearances or engage in "[[ritual]] repairs" when this normalcy breaks down. It is the mandate to "accept anything that is taking place as normal and ordinary as long as you can bear to do so and contribute to maintaining this normality" (Vollmer 2013).

> This principle of affirmation can be considered as a straightforward application of what Alfred Schütz (1964) has famously called the "natural attitude" of everyday life, an attitude of playing along so that "any key that is mutually recognized as the key becomes _the_ key" (Schelling 1960). 

Such players, Schütz writes, are "not interested in finding out whether this world really does exist or whether it is merely a coherent system of consistent appearances" (_cf._ [[opticratics]] and [[social reality]]).

## When does coordination become explicit?

Coordination becomes explicit only when tacit coordination breaks down. People tend to find processes of explicit coordination, and communication of internal desires or agendas, a painful and cognitively taxing process, avoiding it wherever possible.

> social situations in which explicit forms of coordination are prevalent is constituted by instances in which breakdowns of coordination have occurred, and these situations illustrate particularly well participants' preference for tacit coordination

Explicit negotiation, as demonstrated in the results of (e.g.) Garfinkel's breaching experiments, proved to be "stressful, risky, and forbidding" to players.

### Garfinkel's "et cetera" clause

However, it appears that no explicit coordination is purely explicit; tacit coordination is required "to put explicit agreements into effect," because even explicit contractual terms are [[fuzzy]] and ambiguous. Garfinkel (1967) calls this the "et cetera clause," and writes:

> No matter how specific the terms of common understandings may be—a contract may be considered the prototype—they attain the status of an agreement only insofar as the stipulated conditions carry along an unspoken but understood _et cetera_ clause [...] Therefore it is both misleading and incorrect to think of an agreement as an actuarial device whereby persons are enabled as of any Here and Now to predict each other's future activities. More accurately, common understandings that have been formulated under the rule of an agreement are used by persons to normalize whatever their actual activities turn out to be.

Vollmer writes:

> Garfinkel's comments on the 'et cetera clause" indicate the general character of tacit coordination in following not only agreements, but also any type of rule: if a rule were to spell out all cases of its future application, it would lose its general character and lead to monstrous specifications of rules about the rules for the rules of using rules... any rule able to coordinate participants' moves (whether implicit or explicit) requires a community of players trained in applying the rule. [_In other words, rules are inherently [[fuzzy]]; see also [[Spirit Vs Letter]] entry._]

Continuing along the lines of the et cetera clause, Vollmer argues that a "completely explicit," non-[[fuzzy]] form coordination in which "participants [are] able to give signals that would unambiguously specifiy which moves to make," is impossible:

> While there are many requests that participants of everyday interaction consider to be as explicit as they may possibly be ("kiss me," "pass me the ball," "show me your ID," etc), such perceptions of explicitness come by virtue of participants being well-trained members of the same collective.

Finally:

> Sending coordinating signals that are explicit enough "for all practical purposes" and being content to receive them is an articulation of the "et cetera clause," and it implicitly signals a general willingness to work out the specifics of any direction, plea or order, in tacit coordination.

## Doing "being sociable"

Vollmer expands on Georg Simmel's 1950 work on sociability, where certain topics are avoided, and "participants' attention is drawn away from long-term convictions or commitments," avoiding model conflict and focusing instead on areas of anticipated model agreement (e.g. opinions on weather, common sentiments in the workforce or [[fields|field]], etc).

> The effort to be sociable will restrain participants from introducing into an encounter anything that might be divisive with respect to the solidarity in play, and while they will certainly have serious longer-term commitment and convictions to live up to, and may know or guess each other's to some extent, participants will generally tacitly avoid them.

> Not every encounter, of course, is sociable in this manner, but, like doing being ordinary, doing being sociable will provide players with an orientation of how to go along, allowing others to go along, of how to join an engagement from outside the initial ecological huddle and allowing others to do the same.

## Disappointment as surprisal, and the costly epistemic arrangements of groupthink

Vollman refers to "disappointments" where Friston or Clark might say "surprisal," e.g.:

> While a tendency to be extra careful not to offset "current interaction arrangements" is one way of keeping coordination in equilibrium in the face of potential [predictive] disappointments, another is to cultivate expectations that tolerate a wide variety of events and activities.

Vollman writes that, while members of an organization or subculture in which "an unlikely version of normality is projected from precedence" will "face increased risk of being [predictively] disappointed by divergent moves," this risk may "ironically... back up the stability of coordination equilibria once participants realize the initial vulnerability of expectations and will accordingly be particularly careful not to offset them, as in groupthink dynamics." In other words, it is costly to maintain such beliefs, requiring the subject to actively avoid outsiders (whose models will differ, thus upsetting their own models), or to avoid reality-testing behavior, etc.
