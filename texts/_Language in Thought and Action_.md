> Human beings are the _talking_ animals. Any theory of human survival that leaves this fact out of account is no more scientific than would be a theory of beaver survival that failed to consider the interesting uses a beaver makes of its teeth and flat tail.

# Language as creating an extended nervous system

Language, by creating a signaling system between boundaried agents, hooks us up into an extended nervous system:

> If someone shouts at you, "Look out!" and you jump just in time to avoid being struck by a car, you owe your escape from injury to the fundamental cooperative act by which most of the higher animals survive: namely, communication by means of noises.

> Indeed, most of the time when we are listening to the noises people make, or looking at the black marks on paper that stand for such noises, we are drawing upon the experiences of others in order to make up for what we ourselves have missed... These marks enable us to communicate with people who are beyond the reach of our voices, both in space and in time.

> Socities, both animal and human, might almost be regarded as huge cooperative nervous systems.

This, of course, leads to greater [[evaluation distance]], which increases [[surrogation]] problems.

> Human beings, then, are never dependent for information on direct experience alone. Even those in a primitive culture can make use of the experience of neighbors, friends, relatives, and ancestors, communicated by means of language. Therefore, instead of remaining helpless because of the limitations of their own experience and knowledge, instead of having to rediscover what others have already discovered, instead of exploring the false trails others have explored and repeating their errors, they can _go on from where others left off._ Language, that is to say, makes progress possible.

# On symbols as a means of maintaining this nervous system—and their corruption via selection pressure

> as Susanne K. Langer has said, "The symbol-making function is one of man's primary activities... It is the fundamental process of the mind, and goes on all the time." One may try to live a simple life with little concern for symbols of affluence, social status, and the like, but one soon discovers that the rejection of symbolism is itself symbolic. Wearing a necktie is symbolic, but not wearing a necktie is equally symbolic. Parents and children have had bitter quarrels in recent years over hair styles—long, short, spiked, shaved. Such quarrels are not really about hair but about the symbolic meanings involved in how hair is worn.

> most societies systematically encourage, concerning certain topics, the habitual [[surrogation|confusion of symbols with things symbolized]]. For example, if a Japanese schoolhouse caught fire, it used to be obligatory in the days of emperor worship to try to rescue the emperor's _picture_ (there was one in every schoolhouse), even at the risk of one's life. (If you got burned to death, you were posthumously enobled.)

> In all societies, the symbols of piety, of civic virtue, or of patriotism are often prized above actual piety, civic virtue, or patriotism.

> In one way or another, we are all like the student who cheats on exams in order to make Phi Beta Kappa: it is often more important to have the symbol than what it stands for.

> The habitual confusion of symbols with things symbolized, whether on the part of individuals or societies, is serious enough at all levels of culture to provide a perennial human problem. The charge against the Pharisees, it will be remembered, was that they were obsessively concerned with the symbols of piety at the expense of an adequate concern with its spirit. 

(See also [[idolatry]], the Golden Calf, etc.)

# Inference and judgment

> An inference, as we shall use the term, is _a statement about the unknown based on the known_. On an elementary level, the difference between a report and an inference is demonstrated in the following statement: "He's afraid of women." This statement does not report; it draws an inference from some observable data: "He blushes and stammers whenever a woman speaks to him. He never speaks to women at parties."

However, this passage implies that inference vs. report is a quality of a description (whether or not it is "observable"). More likely, I think, inference vs. report is a _structural_ relationship. As you go up levels of category, from concrete to abstract, each additional level is an inference on the report from below, which is itself an inference, etc. The determination of "blushing"—that is, the categorization of redness in the cheeks—is an inference; the categorization of "cheeks" is an inference, etc. Schutz would call these "pre-interpreted" insofar as the interpretation is automatic rather than considered; in everyday common sense, things just _are_ what they seem. 

Hayawaka implies as much later in the chapter, though he never comes out and says it outright:
> Even to say "He has stolen" is to make an inference and simultaneously to pass a judgment on an act about which there may have been a difference of opinion based on the evidence at the time.

This position threatens to complicate our usual distinction between the descriptive and prescriptive, between is and ought. If categories are pragmatic, implying a "recipe" (Schutz) or procedure for responding to the categorized object, then judgment (normative) necessarily accompanies categorization. See also [[Jonathan Livengood]]'s work on causal attribution (e.g. whether Alice's action is responsible for X outcome) and the interwoven character of mechanical description and ethical blame in our everyday concept of causation.

Still, some language is more judgmental than other language:
> A newspaper reporter may not write, "A crowd of suckers came to listen to Senator Smith last evening in that rickety firetrap and ex-dive that disfigures the south side of town," but rather, "Between 75 and 100 people heard an address last evening by Senator Smith at the Evergreen Gardens near the southern city limits."

Many sciences are founded on the "data" of reports, but consist primarily of inference:
> a geologist may use the facts from a report to advise an oil company whether or not to drill in a particular place. The geologist infers from the report that there is oil. A physician making an initial diagnosis examines a patient's symptoms, then makes an inference about an intestinal condition that cannot be seen.

Inference is the reverse of symbolism—the attempt to unpack suspected metonyms. Part extrapolated to whole, after whole has been summarized by part.
> We may infer from the material and cut of a woman's clothes the nature of her wealth or social position; we may infer from the character of the ruins the origin of the fire that destroyed the building; we may infer the nature of the Soviet Union's geopolitical strategy from its actions across the globe; we may infer from the shape of land the path of a prehistoric glacier; we may infer from a halo on an unexposed photographic plate that is has been in the vicinity of radioactive materials.

Typecasting and categorization are forms of prediction:
> To say a man is a "thief" is to say in effect, "He has stolen _and will steal again_"—which is more a prediction than a report. 

Old descriptions and connotations stick around even as contexts change. Hayakawa quotes Aneurin Bevan, _In Place of Fear_:
> He [the student of politics] must also be on his guard against the old words, for the words persist when the reality that lay behind them has changed. It is inherent in our intellectual activity that we seek to imprison reality in our description of it. Soon, long before we realize it, it is we who become the prisoners of the description. From that point on, our ideas degenerate into a kind of folklore which we pass to each other, fondly thinking we are still talking of the reality around us.
> Thus we talk of free enterprise, of capitalist society, of the rights of free associations, of parliamentary government, as though all these things 

# On context

> When David says to James, "Bring me that book, will you?" James looks in the direction of David's pointed finger (physical context) and sees a desk piled with books (physical context); he thinks back over their previous conversation (verbal context) and knows which of those books is being referred to. Interpretation, therefore, must be based on the totality of contexts. If it were otherwise, we should not be able to account for the fact that even if we fail to say what we mean in some situations, or fail to use the right or customary words, people can very frequently understand us. For example:
> 
> A: Gosh, look at that second baseman go!
> B: (Looking): You mean the shortstop?
> A: Yes, that's what I mean
> 
> A: There must be something wrong with the oil line; the engine has started to balk.
> B: Don't you mean gas line?
> A: Yes, didn't I say gas line?

# Prescriptivism, descriptivism

> The writer of a dictionary is a historian, not a lawgiver. If, for example, we had been writing a dictionary in 1890, or even as late as 1919, we would have said that the word "broadcast" meant "to scatter" (seed for example); but we could not have decreed that from 1921 on, the most common meaning of the word should become "to disseminate audible messages, etc., by radio or television transmission."

And a lesson for [[conceptual engineering]], which Hayakawa frames as a form of [[overhaulism]]:
> Most of the attempts made to force living language into a doctrinaire program have failed resoundingly. Jonathan Swift once spoke out acidly against the use of the word "mob" as a corrupt shortening of the Latin term _mobile vulgus_. Dr. Samuel Johnson resisted, to no avail, the admission of the word "civilization" into his dictionary because it seemed to him a barbarism, despite its respectable Latin root. In this century, Mussolini tried to eliminate the informal _tu_ in Italian (the second person singular pronoun, whose English counterpart, "thou," has disappeared in ordinary English usage). He covered Italy with posters commanding Italians to use the _voi_ form instead. His campaign failed. The social forces that created the words in the first place could not be changed by logic, fiat, or program.

# Strategic language

> Once in a while [the ordinary man] is struck by the fact that some people (although he never includes himself among these) “twist the meanings of words,” especially during the course of arguments, so that words are often “very tricky.” Occasionally, too, he notices, usually with irritation, that words sometimes “mean different things to different people.” This condition, he feels, would be cured if people would only consult their dictionaries oftener and learn the “true meanings” of words. He knows, however, that they will not—at least, not any oftener than he does, which is not very often—so that he puts this down as another instance of the weakness of human nature.
^86539d

Among the pitfalls of language use include:
> The fact that the implications of one set of terms may lead inevitably into blind alleys while the implications of another set of terms may not; the fact that the historical or sentimental associations that some words have make calm discussion impossible so long as those words are employed; the fact that language has a multitude of different kinds of uses, and that great confusion arises from mistaking one kind of use for another

After describing a town which frames its welfare policy as insurance, changing recipients' and tax-payers' attitudes toward receiving welfare:
> "That just goes to show," said the Advertising Executive, who was known as a realistic thinker, "what good promotional work can do. B-ville's city council had real advertising sense, and that civic ceremony was a masterpiece... made everyone happy... put over the scheme in a big way. Reminds me of the way we do things in our business: as soon as we called horse-mackerel 'tuna-fish,' we developed a big market for it. I suppose if you called welfare 'insurance,' you could actually get people to like it, couldn't you?"
^828806

But unfortunately, the "[[natural attitude]]" is to reify [[typification|typifyications]]:
> "What do you mean, 'calling' it insurance?" asked the Social Worker. "B-ville's scheme wasn't welfare at all. It _was_ insurance." [...]
> 
> [Advertising executive:] "You're crazy. Welfare is welfare, isn't it? If you only call things by their right names..."

Politicians may speak abstractly and [[genericism|generically]], so that listeners project and "fill in" the gaps:
> The platforms of the major parties are almost always phrased at high levels of abstraction (they "mean all things to all men," as the cynical say), but they are often understood by voters to be more specific) that is, at lower levels of abstraction) than they are.

# On the pre-symbolic functions of language

> Infants understand the love, the warmth, or the irritation in a mother's voice long before they are able to understand her words. Mots children retain this sensitivity to presymbolic elements in language. It even survives in adults; they are the people credited with "intuition" or "unusual tact." Their talent lies in their ability to interpret tones of voice, facial expressions, body language, and other symptoms of the internal condition of the speaker. They listen not only to _what_ is said, but to _how_ it is said. 

Those trained on the written word often end up [[literalism|literalist]]:
> On the other hand, people who have spent much of their lives in the study of _written_ symbols (scientists, intellectuals, accountants) are often relatively deaf to everything but the surface sense of the words. If a young woman wants a person of this kind to kiss her, she usually has to tell him in so many words or actions. 

# On the establishment and maintenance of communication lines

> We talk about nothing at all and thereby establish friendships. The purpose of the talk is not the communicatino of information, as the symbols used would seem to imply ("I see the Dodgers are out in the lead again") but the establishment of communion.

This communion or togetherness is, I would think, supplemented by the function of feeling out one anothers' priors, perspectives, etc. Discovering synchronous perspectives, values, desires, proclivities etc. allows opportunities for future coordination (to mutual advantage). Discovering potential pain points of divergence allow tact, for instance in avoiding the creation of tension when those subjects arise.

> Since the purpose of this kind of talk is the establishment of communion, _we are careful to select subjects about which agreement is immediately possible_. Consider, for example, what happens when two strangers feel the necessity or the desire to talk to each other:
> "Nice day, isn't it?"
> 
> > "It certainly is." (_Agreement on one point has been established. It is safe to proceed._)
> > 
> > "Altogether, it's been a fine summer."
> > 
> > "Indeed it has. We had a nice spring too." (_Agreement on two points having been established, the second party invites agreement on a third point._)
> > 
> > "Yes, it was a lovely spring." (_Third agreement reached._)
> 
> The togetherness, therefore, is not merely in the talking itself, but in the opinions expressed... _With each new agreement, no matter how commonplace or obvious, the fear and suspicion of the stranger wears away, and the possibility of friendship enlarges._

Once communication lines have been established, they must be maintained. "Chatter," be it among telephone operators, army signal corps outposts, co-habitants in a household, etc serves "partly to relieve tension, but partly, and more importantly, to keep the lines of communication open."
> How does one know that the lines of communication are still open unless one keeps them working? A sound engineer who says into a microphone, "One... two... three... four... testing" isn't saying anything much. But it is nevertheless important at times that it be said.

Furthermore, I would speculate, once a line of communication has been silent for a long time, it becomes increasingly difficult to open them again, in part because any pretense for opening must almost necessarily be heightened, to combat inertia, and thus a "casual" remark will seem less than casual. 

> Ignorance of the existence of these presymbolic uses of language is not so common among uneducated people (who often perceive such things intuitively) as it is among the educated. The educated often listen to the chatter at parties and receptions, and conclude from the triviality of the conversation that all the guests (except themselves) are fools. They may discover that people often come away from church services without any clear memory of the sermon and conclude that churchgoers are either fools or hypocrites. They may hear the political oratory of the opposition party, wonder "how anybody can believe such rot," and conclude therefore that people in general are so unintelligent that democracy is unworkable. Almost all such gloomy conclusions about the stupidity or hypocrisy of our friends and neighbors are unjustifiable on such evidence, because they usually come from apply the standards of symbolic language to linguistic events that are either partly or wholly presymbolic in character.

# Language as social control

> What we call "commands," "please," "requests," and "orders" are the simplest ways we have of making things happen by means of words. There are, however, more roundabout ways. When we say, for example, "Our candidate is a great American," we are of course uttering an enthusiastic "purr" about that candidate, but we may also be trying to influence how other people vote. Again, when we say, "Our war against the enemy is God's war. God wills that we must triumph," we are saying something that cannot be scientifically verified: nevertheless, it may influence others to help in the prosecution of the war. Or if we merely state as a fact, "Milk contains calcium," we may be influencing others to buy milk.

Hayakawa calls these "directive utterances."

> Consider, too, such a statement as "I'll meet you tomorrow at two o'clock in front of Union Station." Such a statement about _future_ events can only be made, it will be observed, in a system in which symbols are independent of things symbolized... That is to say, a map can be made despite the fact thtat the territory it stands for is not yet an actuality. Guiding ourselves by means fo such maps of territories-to-be, we can impose a certain predictability upon future events.

> Directive utterances say something about the future... They [are maps which] direct us to do certain things with the stated or implied promise that if we do these things, certain consequences will follow. "If you adhere to the Bill of Rights, your civil rights too will be protected." "If you vote for me, I will have your taxes reduced."

> If we can rely upon what directive uttterances tell us, the uncertainties of life are reduced. (See [[predictive processing]]'s concept of uncertainty minimization)

Crucially, this control function of language is about _controlling future events_:
> It is for this reason that writers write; preachers preach; employers, parents, and teachers scold; propagandists send out news releases; politicians give speech. All of them, for various reasons, are trying to influence our conduct—sometimes for our own good, sometimes for their own.

Some of our directive utterances are "accompanied by ritual," and a collective social sanction which "try to impose patterns of behavior upon the individual in the interests of the whole group." Archaic language may be employed to formalize the event, e.g. "Wilt thou, John, take this woman for thy lawful wedded wife?" or "This lease, made the tenth day of July..." And they are often accompanied by "appeals to supernatural powers" who will "help carry out the vows, or to punish us if we fail to carry them."
> An oath for example, ends with the words "So help me God." Prayers, incantations, and invocations accompany the utterance of important vows in practically all cultures, from the most primitive to the most civilized.
> If God does not punish us for failing to carry out [these] agreements, it is made clear, either by statement or implication, that our society will. For example, we all regalize taht we can be imprisoned for desertion, nonsupport, or bigamy; sued for "breach of contract"; "defrocked" for activities contrary to priestly vows...

# On typification

Quoting T. E. Hulme:
![[_Speculations_#^add447]]

This typifying behavior, which is part of the [[natural attitude]], must have attention drawn to it if we wish to break free:
> If our ideas and beliefs are held with an awareness of abstracting, they can be changed if found to be inadequate or erroneous. But if they are held without an awareness of abstracting—if our mental maps are believed _to be the territory_—they are prejudices.

# Hayakawa on classification

Quoting [[Oliver Wendell Holmes]]:
![[Oliver Wendell Holmes#^0b5681]]

Quoting P.W. Bridgman:
> But of course the true meaning of a term is to be found by observing what a man does with it, not by what he says about it.

> Things can have "right names" only if there is a necessary connection between symbols and things symbolized, and we have seen that there is not.

> For example, animals are classified in one way by the meat industry, in a different way by the leather industry, in another different way by the fur industry, and in a still different way by the biologist.

> Are... classifications "real"? Of course they are, and the effect that each of them has upon what he may or may not do constitutes their "reality."
^38a000

[[strategic conceptualization]]: When consequences are the result of categorization, people will perform categories to get their desired consequences.
> When one person kills another, is it an act of murder, an act of temporary insanity, an act of homicide, an accident, or an act of heroism? As soon as the process of classification is completed, our attitudes and our conduct are, to a considerable degree, determined. We hang the murderer, we treat the insane, we absolve the victim of circumstance, we pin a medal on the hero.

> [The] extraordinarily fatuous saying "[[the exception proves the rule]]" originally meant, "The except tests the rule"—_Exceptio probat regulum._ This older meaning of the word "prove" survives in such an expression as "automobile proving ground."
^2ce843

> when a father tries to excuse the mischief done by his sons, he says, "Boys will be boys"; in other words, "Let us regard the actions of my sons with that indulgent amusement customarily extended toward those whom we call 'boys,'" though the angry neighbor will say, of course, "Boys, my eye! They're little hoodlumsl that's what they are!" Such assertions are not informative statements but directives, directing us to classify the object or event under discussion in given ways, in order that we may feel or act as suggested by the terms of the classification.
^efe0ee

> Many semantic problems are, ultimately, problems of classification and nomenclature. Take, for example, the extensive debate over abortion. To opponents of legalized abortion, the unborn entity within a woman's womb is a "baby." Because abortion foes _want_ to end abortion, they insist that the "baby" is a human being with its own legal rights and that therefore "abortion is murder." They call themselves "pro-life" to emphasize their position. Those who _want_ individual women to be able to choose whether or not to end a pregnancy call that same unborn entity a "fetus" and insist that the "fetus" _is not_ a viable human being capable of living on its own, and claim that a woman has a "right" to make such a choice. Partisans of either side have accused the other of "perverting the meanings of words" and of "not being able to understand plain English." [...] When the desired [Supreme Court] decision is handed down, people will say, "Truth has triumphed." Society, in short, regards as "true" those systems of classification that produce the desired results.
