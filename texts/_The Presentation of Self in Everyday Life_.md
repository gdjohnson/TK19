# Performances

Goffman's *performance* is "all the activity of an individual which occurs during a period marked by [an individual's] continuous presence before a particular set of observers and which has some influence on the observers." 

A *front*, meanwhile, is "the expressive equipment of a standard kind intentionally or unwittingly employed by the individual during his performance." Sometimes, performers rely on a "set" which they either opportunistically seize, travel to for performances, or carry with them as in the case of "the funeral cortege, the civic parade, and the dream-like processions that kings and queens are made of."

The purpose of performance is to establish and maintain an definition of the situation, a claim to reality. At various points in his career, Goffman calls this a "line" or "frame." This definition, which we can also call an impression (the interpretation or model the observer has of the observed), is employed in order to achieve strategic aims. Similarly, we could say that performers are attempting to advance a [[framing|frame]], an overarching conception of the "whole" which guides interpretation of parts, even as it is created by parts (cf [[cybernetics]] and feedback loops).

To put a [[predictive processing|Fristonian]] twist on it, we could say that frames, once established, set up expectations or anticipations by observers, and if this expectation set is subverted too many times by expressive gestures or performer actions (e.g. the three fingers slip in _Inglourious Basterds_, or a misspelled word in an official document) then we begin to call into question the hermeneutic whole (the frame or definition being advanced).

It is a mistake to "assume that the content of [a performance] is merely an expressive extension of the character of the performer." Often, the performance serves "mainly to express the characteristics of the task that is performed," or to front an organization or "team."

## Belief in the part one is playing

> When an individual plays a part he implicitly requests his observers to take seriously the impression that is fostered before them. They are asked to believe that the character they see actually possesses the attributes he appears to possess, that the task he performs will have the consequences that are implicitly claimed for it, and that, in general, matters are what they appear to be. 

Goffman takes the Trivers [[deception#Self-deception|self-deception]] stance:
> At one extreme, we find that the performer can be fully taken in by his own act; he can be sincerely convinced that the impression of reality which he stages is the real reality... At the other extreme, we find that the performer may not be taken in at all... This possibility is understandable, since no one is in quite as good an observational position to see through the act as the person who puts it on. 

> When the individual has no belief in his own act and no ultimate concern with the beliefs of his audience, we may call him cynical, reserving the term sincere for individuals who believe in the impression fostered by their own performance.

> It is not assumed... that all cynical performers are interested in deluding their audiences for purposes of what is called "self-interest" or private gain. A cynical individual may delude his audience for what he considers to be illustrations of their own good, or for the good of the community, etc. For illustrations of this we need not appeal to sadly enlightened showmen such as Marcus Aurelius or Hsun Tzu. We know that in service occupations practitioners who may otherwise be sincere are sometimes forced to delude their customers because their customers show such a heartfelt demand for it. Doctors who are led into giving placebos, filling-station attendants who resignedly check and recheck tire pressures for anxious women motorists, shoe clerks who sell a shoe that fits but tell the customer it is the size she wants to hear—these are cynical performers whose audiences will not allo wthem to be sincere.

The roles we play eventually come to feel natural, and thus can be sincerely performed. Military recruits may first follow army etiquette to avoid punishment, and soon internalize them as important. Or:
> For the last four or five years the island's tourist hotel has been owned by a married couple of crofter origins. From the beginning, the owners were forced to set aside their own conceptions as to how life ought to be led, displaying in the hotel a full round of middle-class services and amenities. Lately, however, it appears that the managers have become less cynical about the performance that they stage; they themselves are becoming middle class and more and more enamoured of the selves their clients impute to them.
^b7f380

Correspondingly, "the cycle of disbelief-to-belief can be followed in the other direction, starting with conviction or insecure aspiration and ending in cynicism":
> Professions which the public holds in religious awe often allow their recruits to follow the cycle in this direction, and often recruits follow it in this direction not because of a slow realization that they are deluding their audience—for by ordinary social standards the claims they make may be quite valid—but because they can use this cynicism as a means of insulating their inner selves from contact with the audience. And we may even expect to find typical careers of faith, with the individual starting out with one kind of involvement in the performance he is required to give, then moving back and forth several times between sincerity and cynicism before completing all the phases and turning-points of self-belief for a person of his station.

Shamanism is perhaps our best anthro-historical example of opticratics at work. Goffman quotes Kroeber, _The Nature of Culture_:
> Next, there is the old question of deception. Probably most shamans or medicine men, the world over, help along with sleight-of-hand in curing and especially in exhibitions of power. This sleight-of-hand is sometimes deliberate; in many cases awareness is perhaps not deeper than the foreconscious. The attitude, whether there has been represession or not, seems to be as toward a pious fraud. Field ethnographers seem quite generally convinced that even shamans who know that they add fraud also believe in their powers, and especially in thoes of other shamans: they consult them when they themselves or their children are ill.

Like Marcus Aurelius or the doctor, shamans are an example of pro-social performance. Performances are overall value neutral; some are selfless and role appropriate; others are self-advancing. 

Quoting Macgowan, _Sidelights on Chinese Life_: "He is an ideal-looking official, for he is large and massive in appearance, whilst he has that stern and uncomprising look that is supposed to be necessary in any magistrate who would hope to keep his subjects in order. He has a stern and forbidding aspect, as though he were on his way to the execution ground to have some criminal decapitated."

Metaphor plays a strong role insofar as different fronts reference one another in order to signify. Visual language, like spoken language, comes prefab; one cannot (merely through intent) will a new meaning into existence, for the bottleneck is always the interpreter. "Observers then only need be familiar with a small and hence manageable vocabulary of fronts and know how to respond to them in order to orient themselves in a wide variety of situations"—see also [[typification]]. But this excerpt implies a strange teleology—fronts do not take the "ease" of memory of observers into account, rather, they take into account the _lack_ of observer knowledge as to some new signification field, and instead reference an existing conventional signification, in order to be understood. Thus,
> if the individual takes on a task that is not only new to him but also unestablished in the society, or if he attempts to change the light in which the task is viewed, he is likely to find that there are already several well-established fronts among which he must choose.

In other words, "fronts tend to be selected, not created." This is why we must recycle via [[analogy|metaphor]] the concepts of yesterday, to represent the world of today.

> a given social front tends to become institutionalized in terms of the abstract stereotyped expectations to which it gives rise, and tends to take on a meaning and stability apart from the specific tasks which happen at the time to be performed in its name. The front becomes a "collective representation" and a fact in its own right. [cf [[typification]]]

## Dramatic realization
"Sometimes you have to show the ref what's going on." (Richard Jefferson, announcing WCSF G7)

> While in the presence of others, the individual typically infuses his activity with signs which dramatically highlight and portray confirmatory facts that might otherwise remain unapparent or obscure.

> activity oriented towards work-tasks tends to be converted into activity oriented towards communication

Fields or activities whose abstract qualities are not [[legibility|legible]] present a problem. Goffman quotes a study by Edith Lentz on the differences in visible work for surgical vs. medical nursing staff:
> The things which a nurse does for post-operative patients on the surgical floor are frequently of recognizable importance, even to patients who are strangers to hospital activities.  For example, the patient sees his nurse changing bandages, swinging orthopedic frames into place, and can realize that these are purposeful actiities. 
> Medical nursing... The physician's diagnosis must rest upon careful observation of symptoms over time where the surgeon's are in larger part dependent on visible things. The lack of [[legibility|visibility]] creates problems on the medical. A patient will see his nurse stop at the next bed and chat for a moment or two with the patient there. He doesn't know that she is observing the shallowness of the breathing and color and tone of the skin. He thinks she is just visiting.

Invisible costs must be made visibile; invisible (desirable) qualities must be advertised. And yet to do so can be costly; see also [[James T. Wilson]], [[_Bureaucracy_]] on the dueling public relations and management duties of the administrator:
> The work that must be done by those who fill certain statuses is often so poorly designed as an expression of a desired meaning, that if the incumbent would dramatize the character of his role, he must divert an appreciable amount of his energy to do so. 

One's skill at [[opticratics]] and one's skill at the task itself are often divergent abilities, meaning that selection games which incorporate one come at cost of the other:
> And this activity diverted to communication will often require different attributes from the ones which are being dramatized. Thus to furnish a house so that it will express simple, quiet dignity, the householder may have to race to auction sales, haggle with antique dealers, and doggedly canvass all the local shops for proper wallpaper and curtain materials. To give a radio talk that will sound genuinely informal, spontaneous, and relaxed, the speaker may have to design his script with painstaking care, testing one phrase after another in order to follow the content, language, rhythm, and pace of everyday talk. Similarly, a _Vogue_ model, by her clothing, stance, and facial expression, is able expressively to portray a cultivated understanding of the book she poses in her hand; but those who trouble to express themselves so appropriately will have very little time left over for reading. And so individuals often find themselves with the dilemma of expression _versus_ action.

In such fields, talent for self-marketing can outperform talent in the domain proper, especially if actual results are difficult to assess, as in e.g. health or educational outcomes. Image and substance decouple; the surface markers gain an association which others channel, but without its inhabiting, originary spirit. 
> executives often project an air of competency and general grasp of the situation, blinding themselves and others to the fact that they hold their jobs partly because they look like executives, not because they can work like executives.

## Idealization

> a performance is, in a sense, "socialised," moulded and modified to fit into the understanding and expectations of the society in which it is presented.

> an idealized impression is offered by accentuating certain facts and concealing others.

The impression we give off is idealized, but idealized how?
> when the individual presents himself before others, his performance will tend to incorporate and exemplify the officially accredited values of the society, more so, in fact, than does his behaviour as a whole. 

This applies not just to individuals but to fields. Goffman cites Charles Cooley, _Human Nature & The Social Order_, on how scientism takes hold via surrogation:
> And the same impulse to show the world a better or idealized aspect of ourselves finds an organized expression in the various professions and classes, each of which has to some extent a cant or pose, which its members assume unconsciously, for the most part, but which has the effect of a conspiracy to work upon the credulity of the rest of the world. There is a cant not only of theology and of philanthropy, but also of law, medicine, teaching, even of science—perhaps especially of science, just now, since the more a particular kind of merit is recognized and admired, the more it is likely to be assumed by the unworthy. As theology goes down and science comes up, the affectation of disinterestedness and of exactness in method tends to supplant the affectation of piety.

Conformity to the existing meanings of signs is not passive but active; it leverages the existing structure for personal gain, but in doing so helps affirm this order cybernetically:
> we may look upon [a performance], in the manner of [[Émile Durkheim|Durkheim]] and [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown|Radcliffe-Brown]], as a ceremony—as an expressive rejuvenation and reaffirmation of the moral values of the community.

> Commonly we find that [[class|upward mobility]] involves the presentation of proper performances and that efforts to move upward and efforts to keep from moving downward are expressed in terms of sacrifices made for the maintenance of front.
> We also find that [[class|middleclass]] housewives sometimes employ—in a secret and surreptitious way—cheap substitutes for coffee, ice cream, or butter; in this way they can save money, or effort, or time, and still maintain an impression that the food they serve is of high quality. The same women may leave _The Saturday Evening Post_ on their living room end table but keep a copy of _True Romance_ ("It's something the cleaning woman must have left around") concealed in their bedroom.

When a performer must make a favorable impression on multiple fronts or qualities of his work, then he will "sacrifice those standards whose loss can be concealed" (i.e. those which are less intrinsically [[legibility|legible]]) and "make this sacrifice in order to maintain standards whose inadequate application cannot be concealed."

Individuals idealize their motivations, and hide selfish motivations:
> And so we find that clergymen give the impression that they entered the church because of a call of felt vocation, in America tending to conceal their interest in [[class|moving up socially]], in Britain tending to conceal their interest in not moving too far down.

Finally, we idealize in such a way as to give an impression of "uniqueness"—we do not visibly repeat the same compliment or line to multiple individuals at a party; a doctor makes a show of personalized service or "bed-side manner"; a "crass pseudo-gemeinschaft"—pseudo-communitas—Goffman calls it.

## Maintenance of expressive control

> It has been suggested that the performer can rely upon his audience to accept minor cues as a sign of something important about his performance. This convenient fact has an inconvenient implication. By virtue of the same sign-accepting tendency, the audience may misunderstand the meaning that a cue was designed to convey, or may read an embarrassing meaning into gestures or events that were accidental, inadvertent, or incidental and not meant by the performer to carry any meaning whatsoever.
> 
> In response to these communication contingencies, performers commonly attempt to exert a kind of **synecdochic responsibility**, making sure that as many as possible of the minor events in the performance, however instrumentally inconsequential as these events may be, will occur in such a way as to convey either no impression or an impression that is compatible and consistent with the over-all definition of the situation that is being fostered.

> as students we must be ready to examine the dissonance created by a misspelled word, or by a slip that is not quite concealed by a skirt; and we must be ready to appreciate why a near-sighted plumber, to protect the impression of rough strength that is _de reigueur_ in his profession, feels it necessary to sweep his spectacles into his pocket when the house-wife's approach changes his work into a performance... In other words, we must be prepared to see that the impression of reality fostered by a performance is a delicate, fragile thing that can be shattered by very minor mishaps.

> As human beings we are presumably creatures of variable impulse with moods and energies that change from one moment to the next. As characters put on for an audience, however, we must not be subject to ups and downs. As Durkheim suggested, we do not allow our higher social activity "to follow in the trail of our bodily states, as our sensation sand our general bodily consciousness do." A certain **bureaucratization of the spirit** is expected so that we can be relied upon...

^8158c9
(That is, we bureaucratize ourselves to that we can be made predictable and [[legibility|legible]].)

Goffman quotes from [[George Santayana]] at length:
> But whether the visage we assume be a joyful or a sad one, in adopting and emphasizing it we define our sovereign temper. Henceforth, so long as we continue under the spell of this self-knowledge, we do not merely live but act; we compose and play our chosen character, we wear the buskin of deliberation, we defend and idealize our passions, we encourage ourselves eloquently to be what we are, devoted or scornful or careless or austere; **we soliloquize (before an imaginary audience)** and we wrap ourselves gracefully in the mantle of our inalienable part. So draped, we solicit applause and expect to die amid a universal hush. We profess to live up to the fine sentiments we have uttered, as we try to believe in the religion we profess. The greater our difficulties the greater our zeal. **Under our published principles and plighted language we must assiduously hide all the inequalities of our mood and conduct, and this without hypocrisy, since our deliberate character is more truly ourself than is the flux of our involuntary dreams.** The portrait we paint this way and exhibit as our true person may well be in the grand manner, with column and curtain and distant landscape and finger pointing to the terrestrial globe or to the Yorick-skull of philosophy; but if this style is native to us and our art is vital, the more it transmutes its model the deeper and truer art it will be. The severe bust of an archaic sculpture, scarcely humanizing the block, will express the spirit far more justly than the man's dull morning looks or casual grimaces. Everyone who is sure of his mind, or proud of his office, or anxious about his duty assumes a tragic mask. He deputes it to be himself and transfers to it all its vanity. **While still alive in subject, like all existing things, to the undermining flux of his own substance, he has crystallized his soul into an idea, and more in pride than in sorrow he has offered up his life on the altar of the Muses**. Self-knowledge, like any art or science, renders its subject-matter in a new medium, the medium of ideas, in which it loses its old dimension and its old place. Our animal habits are transmuted by conscience into loyalties and duties, and we become "person" or masks.

^fb159d
## Misrepresentation

> If [the] tendency of the audience to accept signs places the performer in a position to be misunderstood and makes it necessary for him to exercise expressive care regarding everything he does when before the audience, so also this sign-accepting tendency puts the audience in a position to be duped and misled, for there are few signs that cannot be used to attest to the presence of something that is not really there.

> we often give special attention to features of the performance that cannot be readily manipulated, thus enabling ourselves to judge the reliability of the more misrepresentable cues in the performance. (Scientific police work and projective testing are extreme examples of the application of this tendency.) 

> Claims to be a law graduate can be established as valid or invalid, but claims to be a friend, a true believer, or a music-lover can be confirmed or disconfirmed only more or less. where standards of competence are not objective, and where _bona fide_ practitioners are not collectively organized to protect their mandate, an individual may style himself an expert and be penalized by nothing stronger than sniggers.
> 

Our attitude toward illusion and deception is highly variable, depending on social convention:
> It is a culpable thing for a fifteen-year-old boy who drives a car or drinks in a tavern to represent himself as being eighteen, but there are many social contexts in which it would be improper for a woman not to misrepresent herself as being more youthful and sexually attractive than is really the case [e.g. through makeup].
> ...modifications of one's personal front that are considered misrepresentative one year may be considered merely decorative a few years later, and this dissensus may be found at any one time between one subgroup in our society and others.

> Communication techniques such as innuendo, strategic ambiguity, and crucial omissions allow the misinformer to profit from lies without, technically, telling any.

^813d5c
Some degree of misrepresentation is ubiquitous to human social and professional life.
> we find that there is hardly a legitimate everyday vocation or relationship whose performers do not engage in concealed practices which are incompatible with fostered impressions.

> in well-adjusted marriages, we expect that each aprtner may keep from the other secrets having to do with financial matters, past experiences, current flirtations, indulgencies in "bad" or expensive habits, personal aspirations and worries, actions of children, true opinions held about relatives or mutual friends, etc.

^5fc212

These misrepresentations are risky, however: "a discreditable disclosure in one area of an individual's activity will throw doubt on the many areas of activity in which he may have nothing to conceal."

Moreover, the general principles of dramatic realization, mystification, idealization presented in previous sections are also examples of misrepresentation. And this is even ignoring bias-less (non-strategic) errors of misapprehension or miscommunication.
> In general, then, the representation of an activity will vary in some degree from the activity itself and therefore inevitably misrepresent it.

Given this, Goffman wants to shift from frame from asking "What are the ways in which the given impression is false?" to "What are the ways in which a given impression can be discredited?" For instance, many perfectly legitimate behaviors can risk the appearance of impropriety, and are therefore off-limits:
> we know that the formal code of British civil servants and of American baseball umpires obliges them not only to desist from making improper "deals" but also to desist from innocent action which might possibly give the (wrong) impression that they are making deals. Whether an honest performer wishes to convey the truth or whether a dishonest performer wishes to convey a falsehood, both must take care to enliven their performances with appropriate expressions, exclude from their performances expressions that might discredit the impression being fostered, and take care lest the audience imput unintended meanings.

## Reality and contrivance

> let it be said that there are many individuals who sincerely believe that the definition of the situation they habitually project is the real reality.

In such cases, "the performer comes to be his own audiences; he comes to be performer and observer of the same show." _See also [[deception#Self-deception]]_. 

But he also has internalized norms and may carry them on in private: "Presumably he intracepts or incorporates the standards he attempts to maintain in the presence of others so that his conscience requires him to act in a socially proper way... When a performer guides his private activity in accordance with incorporated moral standards, he may associate these standards with a reference group of some kind, thus creating a non-present audience for the activity."

> There are not many French cooks who are really Russian spies, and there are perhaps not many women who play the part of wife to one man and mistress to another, but these duplicities do occur... There is, then, a statistical relation between appearances and reality, not an intrinsic or necessary one.

> Some performances are arried off successfully with complete dishonesty, others with complete honesty; but for performances in general neither of these extremes is essential and neither, perhaps, is dramaturgically advisable.

We wield our roles as if they were a language we speak:
> When we watch a television wrestler gouge, foul, and snarl at his opponent we are quite ready to see that, in spite of the dust, he is, and knows he is, merely playing at being the "heavy" [i.e. "heel"], and that in another match he may be given the other role, that of clean-cut wrestler, and perform this with equal verve and proficiency. We seem less ready to see, however, that while such details as the number and character of the falls may be fixed beforehand, the details of the expressions and movements used do not come from a script but from command of an idiom, a command that is exercised from moment to moment with little calculation or forethought.
> 
> In reading of persons in the West indies who become the "horse" or the one possessed of a voodoo spirit, it is enlightening to learn that the person possessed will be able to provide a correct portrayal of the god that has entered him because of "the knowledge and memories accumulated in a life spent visiting congregations of the cult"; that the person possessed will be in just the right social relation to those who are watching... the possessed one carrying out his ritual obligations to the point of participating in a kind of skit... But in learning this, it is important to see that the contextual structuring of the horse's role still allows participants in the cult to believe that possession is a real thing and that persons are possessed at random by gods whom they cannot select.
> 
> And when we observe a young American middle-class girl playing dumb for the benefit of her boy friend, we are ready to point to items of guile and contrivance in her behavior. But like herself and her boy friend, we accept as an unperformed fact that this performer _is_ a young American middle-class girl.

In other words, identity and personhood _just is_ a performance:
> To _be_ a given kind of person, then, is not merely to possess the required attributes, but also to sustain the standards of conduct and appearance that one's social grouping attaches thereto. The unthinking ease with which performers consistently carry off such standard-maintaining routines does not deny that a performance has occurred, merely that the participants have been aware of it.

# Teams
Goffman then extends the concept of performing actors, to performing teams. These teams form an outside and inside, where the insiders share a familiarity, and together perform a front in solidarity for outsiders. 

Quoting Charles S. Johnson:
> When outsiders are present, the touch of businesslike formality is even more important. You may call your secretary "Mary" and your partner "Joe" all day, but when a stranger comes into your office you should refer to your associates as you would expect the stranger to address them: Miss or Mr. You may have a running joke with the switchboard operator, but you let it ride when you are placing a call in an outsider's hearing. 

Together, individuals create a team performance:
> Whether the members of a team stage similar individual performances or stage dissimilar performances which fit together into a whole, an emergent team impression arises which can conveniently be treated as a fact in its own right, as a third level of fact located between the individual performance on one hand and the total interaction of participants on the other.

They are bound together even as their roles may differ:
> When members of a team have different formal statuses and rank in a social establishment, as if oten the case, then we can see that the mutual dependence created by membership in the establishment and thus provide a source of cohesion for the establishment.

Team mates are defined by familiarity, which is an "intimacy without warmth" whereby they are willing to admit (and coordinate around, and operate on the basis of) insider information that is concealed from the public. In some cases, they are bound by "reciprocal dependence," but in other cases, they are loosely tied together by the fact that the reputation and image of any given individual is dependent on other individuals who share a team front:
> a girl at a party who is flagrantly accessible may be shunned by the other girls who are present, but in certain matters she is part of their team and cannot fail to threaten the definition they are collectively maintaining that girls are difficult sexual prizes.

When sustaining definitions of situations on behalf of a team, one must often coordinate the party line explicitly in advance, to avoid contradiction.
