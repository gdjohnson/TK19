# Goffman: The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life

Goffman's performance is "all the activity of an individual which occurs during a period marked by [an individual's] continuous presence before a particular set of observers and which has some influence on the observers." A "front," meanwhile, is "the expressive equipment of a standard kind intentionally or unwittingly employed by the individual during his performance." Sometimes, performers rely on a "set" which they either opportunistically seize, travel to for performances, or carry with them as in the case of "the funeral cortege, the civic parade, and the dream-like processions that kings and queens are made of."

The purpose of performance is to establish and maintain an definition of the situation. This definition, which we can also call an impression (the interpretation or model the observer has of the observed), is employed in order to achieve strategic aims. Similarly, we could say that performers are attempting to advance a [[framing|frame]], an overarching conception of the "whole" which guides interpretation of parts, even as it is created by parts (cf [[cybernetics]] and feedback loops).

To put a [[predictive processing|Fristonian]] twist on it, we could say that frames, once established, set up expectations or anticipations by observers, and if this expectation set is subverted too many times by expressive gestures or performer actions (e.g. the three fingers slip in _Inglourious Basterds_, or a misspelled word in an official document) then we begin to call into question the hermeneutic whole (the frame or definition being advanced).

## Belief in the Part One is Playing

> When an individual plays a part he implicitly requests his observers to take seriously the impression that is fostered before them. They are asked to believe that the character they see actually possesses the attributes he appears to possess, that the task he performs will have the consequences that are implicitly claimed for it, and that, in general, matters are what they appear to be. 

Goffman takes the Trivers [[deception#Self-deception|self-deception]] stance:
> At one extreme, we find that the performer can be fully taken in by his own act; he can be sincerely convinced that the impression of reality which he stages is the real reality... At the other extreme, we find that the performer may not be taken in at all... This possibility is understandable, since no one is in quite as good an observational position to see through the act as the person who puts it on. 

> When the individual has no belief in his own act and no ultimate concern with the beliefs of his audience, we may call him cynical, reserving the term sincere for individuals who believe in the impression fostered by their own performance.

> It is not assumed... that all cynical performers are interested in deluding their audiences for purposes of what is called "self-interest" or private gain. A cynical individual may delude his audience for what he considers to be illustrations of their own good, or for the good of the community, etc. For illustrations of this we need not appeal to sadly enlightened showmen such as Marcus Aurelius or Hsun Tzu. We know that in service occupations practitioners who may otherwise be sincere are sometimes forced to delude their customers because their customers show such a heartfelt demand for it. Doctors who are led into giving placebos, filling-station attendants who resignedly check and recheck tire pressures for anxious women motorists, shoe clerks who sell a shoe that fits but tell the customer it is the size she wants to hear—these are cynical performers whose audiences will not allo wthem to be sincere.

The roles we play eventually come to feel natural, and thus can be sincerely performed. Military recruits may first follow army etiquette to avoid punishment, and soon internalize them as important. Or:
> For the last four or five years the island's tourist hotel has been owned by a married couple of crofter origins. From the beginning, the owners were forced to set aside their own conceptions as to how life ought to be led, displaying in the hotel a full round of middle-class services and amenities. Lately, however, it appears that the managers have become less cynical about the performance that they stage; they themselves are becoming middle class and more and more enamoured of the selves their clients impute to them.

Correspondingly, "the cycle of disbelief-to-belief can be followed in the other direction, starting with conviction or insecure aspiration and ending in cynicism":
> Professions which the public holds in religious awe often allow their recruits to follow the cycle in this direction, and often recruits follow it in this direction not because of a slow realization that they are deluding their audience—for by ordinary social standards the claims they make may be quite valid—but because they can use this cynicism as a means of insulating their inner selves from contact with the audience. And we may even expect to find typical careers of faith, with the individual starting out with one kind of involvement in the performance he is required to give, then moving back and forth several times between sincerity and cynicism before completing all the phases and turning-points of self-belief for a person of his station.

Shamanism is perhaps our best anthro-historical example of opticratics at work. Goffman quotes Kroeber, _The Nature of Culture_:
> Next, there is the old question of deception. Probably most shamans or medicine men, the world over, help along with sleight-of-hand in curing and especially in exhibitions of power. This sleight-of-hand is sometimes deliberate; in many cases awareness is perhaps not deeper than the foreconscious. The attitude, whether there has been represession or not, seems to be as toward a pious fraud. Field ethnographers seem quite generally convinced that even shamans who know that they add fraud also believe in their powers, and especially in thoes of other shamans: they consult them when they themselves or their children are ill.

Like Marcus Aurelius or the doctor, shamans are an example of pro-social performance. Performances are overall value neutral; some are selfless and role appropriate; others are self-advancing. 

Quoting Macgowan, _Sidelights on Chinese Life_: "He is an ideal-looking official, for he is large and massive in appearance, whilst he has that stern and uncomprising look that is supposed to be necessary in any magistrate who would hope to keep his subjects in order. He has a stern and forbidding aspect, as though he were on his way to the execution ground to have some criminal decapitated."

Metaphor plays a strong role insofar as different fronts reference one another in order to signify. Visual language, like spoken language, comes prefab; one cannot (merely through intent) will a new meaning into existence, for the bottleneck is always the interpreter. "Observers then only need be familiar with a small and hence manageable vocabulary of fronts and know how to respond to them in order to orient themselves in a wide variety of situations"—see also [[typification]]. But this excerpt implies a strange teleology—fronts do not take the "ease" of memory of observers into account, rather, they take into account the _lack_ of observer knowledge as to some new signification field, and instead reference an existing conventional signification, in order to be understood. Thus,
> if the individual takes on a task that is not only new to him but also unestablished in the society, or if he attempts to change the light in which the task is viewed, he is likely to find that there are already several well-established fronts among which he must choose.

In other words, "fronts tend to be selected, not created." This is why we must recycle via [[analogy|metaphor]] the concepts of yesterday, to represent the world of today.

> a given social front tends to become institutionalized in terms of the abstract stereotyped expectations to which it gives rise, and tends to take on a meaning and stability apart from the specific tasks which happen at the time to be performed in its name. The front becomes a "collective representation" and a fact in its own right. [cf [[typification]]]

## Dramatic Realization

> While in the presence of others, the individual typically infuses his activity with signs which dramatically highlight and portray confirmatory facts that might otherwise remain unapparent or obscure.

Fields or activities whose abstract qualities are not [[legibility|legible]] present a problem. Goffman quotes a study by Edith Lentz on the differences in visible work for surgical vs. medical nursing staff:
> The things which a nurse does for post-operative patients on the surgical floor are frequently of recognizable importance, even to patients who are strangers to hospital activities.  For example, the patient sees his nurse changing bandages, swinging orthopedic frames into place, and can realize that these are purposeful actiities. 
> Medical nursing... The physician's diagnosis must rest upon careful observation of symptoms over time where the surgeon's are in larger part dependent on visible things. The lack of [[legibility|visibility]] creates problems on the medical. A patient will see his nurse stop at the next bed and chat for a moment or two with the patient there. He doesn't know that she is observing the shallowness of the breathing and color and tone of the skin. He thinks she is just visiting.

Invisible costs must be made visibile; invisible (desirable) qualities must be advertised. And yet to do so can be costly; see also [[James T. Wilson]], [[_Bureaucracy_]] on the dueling public relations and management duties of the administrator:
> The work that must be done by those who fill certain statuses is often so poorly designed as an expression of a desired meaning, that if the incumbent would dramatize the character of his role, he must divert an appreciable amount of his energy to do so. 

One's skill at [[opticratics]] and one's skill at the task itself are often divergent abilities, meaning that selection games which incorporate one come at cost of the other:
> And this activity diverted to communication will often require different attributes from the ones which are being dramatized. Thus to furnish a house so that it will express simple, quiet dignity, the householder may have to race to auction sales, haggle with antique dealers, and doggedly canvass all the local shops for proper wallpaper and curtain materials. To give a radio talk that will sound genuinely informal, spontaneous, and relaxed, the speaker may have to design his script with painstaking care, testing one phrase after another in order to follow the content, language, rhythm, and pace of everyday talk. Similarly, a _Vogue_ model, by her clothing, stance, and facial expression, is able expressively to portray a cultivated understanding of the book she poses in her hand; but those who trouble to express themselves so appropriately will have very little time left over for reading. And so individuals often find themselves with the dilemma of expression _versus_ action.

In such fields, talent for self-marketing can outperform talent in the domain proper, especially if actual results are difficult to assess, as in e.g. health or educational outcomes. Image and substance decouple; the surface markers gain an association which others channel, but without its inhabiting, originary spirit. 
> executives often project an air of competency and general grasp of the situation, blinding themselves and others to the fact that they hold their jobs partly because they look like executives, not because they can work like executives.

# Idealization

> a performance is, in a sense, "socialised," moulded and modified to fit into the understanding and expectations of the society in which it is presented.

The impression we give off is idealized, but idealized how?
> when the individual presents himself before others, his performance will tend to incorporate and exemplify the officially accredited values of the society, more so, in fact, than does his behaviour as a whole. 

This applies not just to individuals but to fields. Goffman cites Charles Cooley, _Human Nature & The Social Order_, on how scientism takes hold via surrogation:
> And the same impulse to show the world a better or idealized aspect of ourselves finds an organized expression in the various professions and classes, each of which has to some extent a cant or pose, which its members assume unconsciously, for the most part, but which has the effect of a conspiracy to work upon the credulity of the rest of the world. There is a cant not only of theology and of philanthropy, but also of law, medicine, teaching, even of science—perhaps especially of science, just now, since the more a particular kind of merit is recognized and admired, the more it is likely to be assumed by the unworthy. As theology goes down and science comes up, the affectation of disinterestedness and of exactness in method tends to supplant the affectation of piety.

Conformity to the existing meanings of signs is not passive but active; it leverages the existing structure for personal gain, but in doing so helps affirm this order cybernetically:
> we may look upon [a performance], in the manner of [[Émile Durkheim|Durkheim]] and [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown|Radcliffe-Brown]], as a ceremony—as an expressive rejuvenation and reaffirmation of the moral values of the community.

> Commonly we find that [[class|upward mobility]] involves the presentation of proper performances and that efforts to move upward and efforts to keep from moving downward are expressed in terms of sacrifices made for the maintenance of front.
> We also find that [[class|middleclass]] housewives sometimes employ—in a secret and surreptitious way—cheap substitutes for coffee, ice cream, or butter; in this way they can save money, or effort, or time, and still maintain an impression that the food they serve is of high quality. The same women may leave _The Saturday Evening Post_ on their living room end table but keep a copy of _True Romance_ ("It's something the cleaning woman must have left around") concealed in their bedroom.

When a performer must make a favorable impression on multiple fronts or qualities of his work, then he will "sacrifice those standards whose loss can be concealed" (i.e. those which are less intrinsically [[legibility|legible]]) and "make this sacrifice in order to maintain standards whose inadequate application cannot be concealed."

Individuals idealize their motivations, and hide selfish motivations:
> And so we find that clergymen give the impression that they entered the church because of a call of felt vocation, in America tending to conceal their interest in [[class|moving up socially]], in Britain tending to conceal their interest in not moving too far down.

Finally, we idealize in such a way as to give an impression of "uniqueness"—we do not visibly repeat the same compliment or line to multiple individuals at a party; a doctor makes a show of personalized service or "bed-side manner"; a "crass pseudo-gemeinschaft"—pseudo-communitas—Goffman calls it.

## Maintenance of expressive control

> It has been suggested that the performer can rely upon his audience to accept minor cues as a sign of something important about his performance. This convenient fact has an inconvenient implication. By virtue of the same sign-accepting tendency, the audience may misunderstand the meaning that a cue was designed to convey, or may read an embarrassing meaning into gestures or events that were accidental, inadvertent, or incidental and not meant by the performer to carry any meaning whatsoever.
> In response to these communication contingencies, performers commonly attempt to exert a kind of **synecdochic responsibility**, making sure that as many as possible of the minor events in the performance, however instrumentally inconsequential as these events may be, will occur in such a way as to convey either no impression or an impression that is compatible and consistent with the over-all definition of the situation that is being fostered.

> as students we must be ready to examine the dissonance created by a misspelled word, or by a slip that is not quite concealed by a skirt; and we must be ready to appreciate why a near-sighted plumber, to protect the impression of rough strength that is _de reigueur_ in his profession, feels it necessary to sweep his spectacles into his pocket when the house-wife's approach changes his work into a performance... In other words, we must be prepared to see that the impression of reality fostered by a performance is a delicate, fragile thing that can be shattered by very minor mishaps.
