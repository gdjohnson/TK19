I want to sketch a quick walk-through & response to Sarah Perry’s lengthy essay “[Ignorance: A Skilled Practice](https://href.li/?https://carcinisation.com/2020/01/27/ignorance-a-skilled-practice/),” framing it in a way that will make it useful as a back-reference working forward. This post is still somewhat long (2.2k words), but is a 6x compression of the original 12k, despite sneaking in commentary and relevant concepts from thingspace. I’ve broken it up into four sections with one-sentence abstracts:

-   Section I:  “Indexicality” is a property of language in which an utterance’s meaning—or conveyed information—is “filled out” by unstated (i.e. implied) local context.
-   Section II:  Indexicality is everywhere, and to greater degree than we typically presume. All meaning—and most knowledge—is local.
-   Section III: Indexical geniuses, cognitive bias, & the global knowledge game. Gut feelings are smarter—and the social sciences less insightful—than we assume.
-   Section IV: Possible strategies for exploiting our indexical genius while avoiding the epistemological impoverishments of the global knowledge game.

## "Indexicality” describes a property of language in which an utterance’s meaning—or conveyed information—is “filled out” by unstated (i.e. implied) local context.

Indexicality refers to the degree to which local, situational context informs a statement’s meaning. Classically, “indexical” language is a pointing relationship_—_“_I_ did _that_”; “_He_ is _here_”—but as we will see, all language is more-or-less indexical. The difference is in extent. “The professor is in the classroom”: less indexical than “He is here,” but which professor, and which classroom? We’re still pointing; we’re still in a “local” language game. This is not the same as “ambiguity”: a local understands unambiguously the person toward which a pronoun is directed. [[Ambiguity]] is what’s left when the contextual clues cannot resolve the signifier. Rather, it is context sensitivity, an ability to situate a pointer in an ecology.  

In other words, indexicality is a compressive affordance enabled by [[localism]]. Scientific language, which attempts to be globally objective & applicable, tends toward minimizing its statements’ indexicality. “The average human body temp is 98.6 F.” Still, though the local community implied in this statement is geographically broad, it is still temporally indexical. Humans far in the future will likely have different average internal temperatures, as did, likely, historic _homo sapiens_. The community which the utterance presumes—and thus omits from explicit saying—is global, but not timeless.

In other words, we cannot confuse this relatively minimal level of indexicality for its absence altogether. It is the tendency of many who play what Sarah dubs “the global knowledge game” to seek universalizing, global truths. Sarah calls these truths “non-indexicals,” but in the spirit of “most statements are context-sensitive,” it seems more fair to say—even following her own framework—that these statements _imply_, or adopt an air of, non-indexicality, but in actuality only approach it. We can call these pseudo-non-indexicals (PNIs). The overarching point: there is local information that applies to specific situations, and there is global information that purports universal applicability. The emphasis, for Sarah, is in _purporting—_a factoring resonant with some forms of epistemological relativism, and with roots in James Scott-style advocacy for _metis_.

Clearly, we can understand the evolutionary advantage which claims to PNIs enjoy in public relations (which constitutes a significant portion of institutional funding—the critical _selection filter_ of the social sciences). And indeed the worldviews of our institutions these days lean modernist & internationalist, for better and worse.

## Indexicality is everywhere, and in greater degree than typically presumed. All meaning is local.

Sarah then cites [[David Chapman]]’s illustration of the way “any word can mean anything”:

![[_In the Cells of the Eggplant_#^df4120]]

The anthropological lens here is key: a customer has been referred to as “the spinach” because he is closely _associated_ with spinach in the activity for which the linguistic utterance is a tool. “The spinach” stands in for—is indexical to—the implied context, the customer who ought to be served the spinach. The lesson Sarah takes away is that linguistic indexicality is ubiquitous and inescapable. She calls in [[Peter Unger]]’s 1979 “Why There Are No People” to assist, which imagines the way in which, were we given a novel object & a corresponding nonsense word as its “handle” (e.g. “_This_ is a _nacknick_”), we could quickly begin discerning between nearby (not identical, but merely similar) objects “of its type,” and those dissimilar enough to _not_ be of its type. This boundary would be highly [[fuzzy]] but feel real. 

Note that such behavior should _not_ be described as “recognizing” a category but as inventing it, from scratch. Though our language acquisition process may benefit from examples of native speaker usage, or reference to semi-formal definitions as in a classroom setting, we seem to do just fine extrapolating categories on our own. This portion of Unger’s paper serves as an elegant thought experiment for illustrating the inherent vagueness—or “radial cloud” of decreasing relation, birthed by even a _single acquired example_—which characterizes our concepts. (This portrait of concepts as _structured but vague_ has been identified in cognitive science as Rosch’s prototype theory, in philosophy via Zadeh’s [[fuzzy]] sets, in [[LessWrong]] rationalism as a “[cluster in thingspace](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WBw8dDkAWohFjWQSk/the-cluster-structure-of-thingspace),” and by Wittgenstein and [Sarah herself](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2018/12/07/something-runs-through-the-whole-thread/) as a "family of senses,” a thread spun from many overlapping fibers.)

“Every seemingly innocent fragment of information is secretly plotting how to escape its context and cause trouble,” Sarah has [[indexicality#^461753|written elsewhere]]. When a Tweet goes viral—when it leaves its home community, the discursive situation which it was designed to respond to—its indexical information is lost. This lost  content can include irony & affect, local linguistic norms & vocab, and the various reputations & positions of the stances of the discourse. (This is what [[John Nerst]] refers to in [his factoring of](https://everythingstudies.com/2017/12/19/the-signal-and-the-corrective/) the “signal” and “corrective”: [[torque epistemology|a discursive position does not exist in a vacuum, but is reactive to other positions]], setting itself in opposition to them, and thus, the dominant narrative in a community has much effect on how we understanding upstart challenger narratives.) A game of Chinese whispers (or to Americans, “[[telephone effect|Telephone]]”) plays out, where each user of a term distorts its meaning to fit the specifics of his or her own situation. In other words, people _convert_ information as much as they are converted _by_ it.  

## Indexical geniuses, cognitive bias, & the global knowledge game: Gut feelings are smarter—and the social sciences less insightful—than we assume.

Citing [[Alexander Luria]]’s work on illiterate peasants, specifically their refusal to engage in games of [[inference|abstract reasoning]] about topics outside their personal experience:

> The adult peasants would only answer questions based on their own knowledge, and stubbornly refused to make deductions from given premises. “All bears are white where it is snowy. It is snowy in Nova Zembla. What color are the bears in Nova Zembla?” “I don’t know, I have never been to Nova Zembla.” Children with only a year or two of education, however, were easily able to engage… and drew inferences from hypothetical facts outside of their own observation.  

Sarah dubs such uneducated people “indexical geniuses.” It is their ignorance which saves them. (Though my brief synopsis here risks this scanning as primativist fetish, the larger essay—and its “local situation” within Sarah’s larger oeuvre, such as her readings of [[Joseph Henrich]]—has no such air about it.) Here we enter her real thrust, a _correction_ to a dominant narrative in our intellectual culture: behavioral econ, and its associated psychologies of cognitive bias.

[[Gerd Gigerenzer]], perhaps the most prominent of the recent researchers who have challenged [[Kahneman-Tversky]] orthodoxies, is cited from the get-go. I’m aware personally of three types of challenges advanced by Gigerenzer: 

1.  Specific discussions of the ways in which individuals’ supposedly biased statistical intuitions are in fact mathematically sophisticated, e.g. Konold’s [“HTHHT” problem](http://www.math.unl.edu/~sdunbar1/ProbabilityTheory/BackgroundPapers/Penney%20ante/PenneyAnte_CounterintuitiveProbabilities.pdf). ([[Nicholas Nassim Taleb|Taleb]], in economics, has made related arguments as to the failures of psychology labs to take into account the rich context of human life from which actors make decisions, e.g. cumulative tail risk.)
2.  Arguments that behavioral economists misunderstand language, ignoring differences in connotations between two different statements and considering them linguistically “equivalent,” such that differing responses by individuals to the respective statements is cast as “irrational.” (e.g. the connoted difference between “10% chance of mortality” and “90% chance of survival.”)
3.  Theoretical arguments and empirical findings as to the computational benefits of heuristics over probabilistic modeling, and a conceptual argument (i.e. a "frame” or “[model”](https://everythingstudies.com/2020/01/28/its-not-so-only/) disagreement) as to why we ought not to call heuristics “irrational.”

All these are valuable challenges of a regime whose tally of appalling mistakes includes the ludicrous [hot-hand “fallacy.”](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2015/07/09/hey-guess-what-there-really-is-a-hot-hand/) And the cognitive biases of behavioral econ are markedly similar to the floating list of logical "fallacies”: Sarah notes with dismay that criticisms of Rousseau—who wrote child-rearing treatises—on the basis of his abandonment of his children had been dismissed, in discourse, as ad hominem [fallacy]. (As Taleb remarks about the class hypocrisies of Susan Sontag, this is not a question of ethics but information—if a car salesman tries to sell you American-made, but owns a Honda, there might be something wrong with his wares.) To Sarah, the “logical fallacy project” and “cognitive bias project” are both attempts at “bracketing” parts of reality, an out-of-bounds zone for the knowledge game in play. Luckily, all rules are contestable (this is what makes culture and science “infinite” games in the Carsean sense), thus, just as calling the “Rousseau scandal” ad hominem is “a move in the game,” so too is Sarah’s critique of the ad hominem fallacy.

What is the real threat of the global knowledge game? “Overconfidence in [it], especially [among the] social sciences, threatens the production and appreciation of the genuine kind of indexical knowledge that humans are geniuses at producing and using.” Our native rationality is (in Gigerenzer’s term) “ecological”—richly situated and contextual—and we replace it with an impoverished, global formulation which belongs to no one and describes no one.

Social science seeks to explain a broad phenomenon, like “[[learned helplessness]].” A researcher chooses an activity which he believes encapsulates a larger phenomenon, such as: immobilizing dogs, administering electric shocks, freeing the dogs, and seeing if they attempt to escape when shocked once again. The resulting finding—that many dogs did, no longer, attempt to escape, ostensibly believing that they were incapable of it—is used, under the auspices of science, as a metonymic metaphor, more parable than global truth. The specific, contextual behavior—of dogs, no less—is taken as an indicator of some global truth about how learned helplessness operates in humans, indeed, as an indicator that we ourselves are inclined toward learned helplessness. (This is a subclass of the “[[linguistic conquests|narrow-and-conquer]]” method endemic to social science and philosophy, a tactic which will be explored in future posts.)

Next, the metaphor gets picked up by interested parties and further "fitted” to the case they are trying to make, for instance, Lenore Walker’s 1979 “The Battered Woman,” which cites the study in discussion. Each time a social science finding is re-appropriated, it is used in a way which is mostly honest but still adaptive—it is nudged, slowly, to some other belief entirely. A concept is formalized by a social scientist in a way pragmatically useful to a specific situation at hand; forty years later, it’s adopted by institutions for use in situations to which it is ill-fitted; this is even done with an awareness that it the formalization is ill-fitting, but a deep deference in our society for formalized, universal knowledge—which the scholar’s original, indexical factoring has masqueraded as—wins out nonetheless.

## How can we stay in a state of ignorant, indexical genius, and avoid the impoverishing effects of the global knowledge game?

Sarah: “The first step, I think, is to develop an aesthetic for it, to make it less invisible.” (See also: “Politics is about putting things on the table” and the roles of concept handles—or concept “crystallizations”—in assisting our understanding of their extensions.) 

In the way of concrete actions, we can “restore lost context” to social science results which have been elevated to global knowledge parables: Sarah cites Gina Perry’s work on Muzafer Sherif’s Robbers Cave Experiment, and I’m aware of [similar work](http://rationallyspeakingpodcast.org/show/rs-241-thibault-le-texier-on-debunking-the-stanford-prison-e.html) surrounding the much-misunderstood Stanford Prison Experiment. So too with David Rosenhan’s famous experiment with mental hospitals (in which mentally healthy students were admitted by trained psychiatrists, and then attempted to leave). It is no coincidence that the contextualization of these experiments defangs them: their original power was derived from their shocking _contradiction_ of our native intuitions about human beings. When put into their proper context, the behavior of participants is rendered comprehensible; their psychological reactions to the situation at hand is commonsense or easily predicted, and the study adds little to our understanding of people.  

Another approach is to encourage research that recognizes and preserves its subjects’ indexicality, such as already takes place in ethnographic practice broadly. Such research, however, is hindered by the significant amounts of time & resources required of it: many ethnographers first learn the language of a subculture, then spend years or decades immersed in it, learning the nuanced, indexical “truth” of its situation. (One solution is for researchers to focus on ethnographic understandings of their home subcultures, which they are already deeply immersed in—though as the fictional trope of a “naive initiate,” or “foreign correspondent” as protagonist recognizes, much of ethnographic insight comes in the researcher’s transition from outsider to insider, such that norms enjoy a stage of presence-at-hand before being normalized.) Sarah calls for “more [[stamp collecting]], less Darwin” in the social sciences—in other words, more [[local]], particular, & detailed explanations, less [[overhaulism|high-modernist]] theories of everything.

Last, we can engage in “honest fiction”: parables that are upfront about their status as parables. We understand already that a fable, or aphorism, is a guiding structure that can be matched, through resonance, against situations in our own lives; a parable is a possible structure of solution dependent on context. (As a nod toward this, note that many parables contradict one another in their advice given: one toward prudence, another toward bravery, yet another toward agreeableness.) Sarah’s connection of ethnography and [[fiction]] is astute: both good fiction and good ethnography are bottom-up and detail-oriented, rather than theorizing and systematizing.
