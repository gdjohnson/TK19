He'll have to choose between ScarJo and his pornography and it'll tear him apart... which way Western Man

It's interesting that this all centers around the Italian American community/Catholicism too

Catholics always loved them rich imagery huh

I do like the idea that there are these different parts of his life he cares about, and there are inherent conflicts between them

Like his mom wants him to get a gf lol

How can he "have it all"â€”a nice Italian girl to bring him to mom, his Brazzers subscription

you know, the gym=church thing is kind of a popular meme

It's all religion it's all worship

the football too

the moral of the story is Iconoclasm Now

it's interesting that she's played by ScarJo

like

the audience is expected to "know" she's a 10

Right, and it's funny when movies do that, because almost all the actresses they cast are very beautiful by normal standards, and then they draw these more or less arbitrary distinctions between them, which are very minor and subjective and arguable but necessary for plot

the TLP-inspired reading is that it puts the audience in the same position as Jon

where like, he's trying to hype up his friends to convince them she's a 10

the question is whether he, like, actually wants her

He needs "the one" to come round and his only means of/axis for distinguishing is looks

So he needs to convince himself she's off the charts

the shot of ScarJo and Jon kissing at the movie theater, their first romantic moment, their first real date, is surrounded by flashy arcade games

and consumerism (popcorn and ticket stands)

And how his home by contrast is practically monastic

He has this weird combination of asceticism and indulgence happening

I wonder if "actually it's bad to sexualize the commons" is my most conservative opinion

low hemlines prevent red queens from rising up

"I think you should go back to school baby" she says while rubbing her ass up on him LMAO

and how performative their romance is

someone to bring home to mom someone to show off to friends

she can only know she's loved if she's depriving him

what he's willing to do for her is the testament to her value

The mom living through her son's romantic adoration because her own husband has switched to adoring the television

the matching wife-beaters and gold chains is amazing

what a strange vector for competition with ScarJo to emerge

an unlikely sexual rival, but that must be the point

ohhh this is where it comes from, dad's a pig who's sex-obsessed, Johnny's living it up according to dad's standards he's internalized

she's the highest catch according to the same value system that has him watching porn, whereas Julianne Moore is this total left field who defies the rubric

trying to square him BSing about their sex life with the confession BSing (lying to Barb, lying to God) and the general image-maintenance he's doing

She's part of the image obsession, the obsession with maintaining image, they go to the gym together to work on their bodies

"You're gonna look so good in a suit"

She tells him he's a winner so she can tell herself and her friends he's a winner

his obsession with cleaning is kinda admirable, supposed to make him sympathetic?

but it's also tied into clean image stuff? it's for himself on one hand but on the other hand trying to hide his dirty laundry?

Julianne Moore makes it OK to be broken/damaged/messy, whereas she demands and strives for perfection

I love that he breaks his hand on a prius

ScarJo: "What's wrong with you" JGL: "I don't know what's wrong with me"

The conversations he has with God and with ScarJo are continuous

I like the he can't bullshit Julianne Moore the way he can bullshit his priest or ScarJo

this is the crux of what I think a lot of people see in this film, the preference for porn over real sex, and what it says about modern masculinity/sex stuff. Topping being inimical to losing yourself because it becomes ritualized/performative

JM's home is like a real home it's cluttered with possessions

contrast his monastic austerity

the priest cant celebrate with Jonny when he gets a real victory, he gets the same 10 hail marys

"same thing? no difference?"

He's a little kid who did good and wants a gold star

we've seen him walk by the bball pickup game in the gym a dozen times to go lifting. now he's changed, instead of lifting he's gonna play a game

I love that

with other people

a team sport
