_Lost Illusions_, 2021, adapted from Balzac

"A wrong gesture, word or look could ruin a newcomer. A discordant detail equaled slashing a master's painting, or an unmelodious note in an opera." (echoing [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]]'s [[_The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life_]] and the costly [[signaling theory|signal]] concept—costly through the difficulty of ensemble.) ^05402a
