## Memetic Wars Yield Delicious Byproducts

most [[anti-inductive]] games we think about (stock market, flirting) are competing for a shared resource so _copying_ a strategy or designing a strategy that makes another strategy not work as well (e.g. effectively incepting rumors) are key moves. these rely on the “can be scooped” quality [[Natural Hazard]] describes as central to his notion of anti-inductivity.

I would argue that with enough throughput, any kind of game that has Hazard’s notion of anti-inductivity is going to end-up looking like an [[inadequate equilibria|adequate equilibria]] because there are always enough people to push down an “over-priced” strategy

the way we make that “useful” instead of an eternal battle for no reason is by using some byproduct of it:  
**(i)** in the case of the stock market, we want prices to coordinate around  
**(ii)** in the case of flirting, it’s pair mating, because people leave the game and hopefully find _actually_ compatible partners after being given a chance  
**(iii)** in the case of sports and other concrete games, it’s entertainment(edited)  
**(iv)** in the case of price wars between companies, it’s finding the actual bottom price  
**(v)** in the case of personal essays, it’s finding candidates that can read the room (note, this may not be the intention, but it is the “intention” from the historical frame)  
**(vi)** in the case of predator/prey relationships it’s keeping the ecosystem in tact  
**(vii)** in the case of memes/terms, the treadmill of terms actually subsidizes changes in conceptualization, as each new descriptive frame allows for small conceptual changes i.e. the old meaning of “retarded” is actually conceptually outdated, not just politically outdated  
**(viii)** in the case of software features, it causes good features to universal across similar software, e.g. tabs  
**(iix)** in the case of aposematism (e.g. red = poison in nature), it keeps these signals honest in the long term  
**(ix)** in the case of music, it causes genre fusion  
**(x)** in the case of the cold war, it causes the journey to the moon (even if no tech was leaked, which it was, knowing X is possible right now is a kind of leak)  
  
not all of these things are “desirable” but the ecosystem ends-up making use of them, precisely because throughput in anti-inductive games causes reliance on “fundamentals” that can’t be ignored even when you’re playing optimally, e.g. in example (iv) where you can’t lower the price to $0 because it really does cost something to produce
