_Themes: metis vs. episteme, game b vs game a, grounding, tailrisk, rationality, pragmatism, selection, bureaucracy, intelligence._

Two primary goals: (1) move humanity "away from abstract universal aims" (2) "away from the kind of social engineering that brings tail risks to society"

## Prologue: Antaeus Whacked

> [The Greek giant Antaeus] derived his strength from contact with his mother, Earth. Physically separated from contact with Earth, he lost all his powers...  We retain from this first vignette that, just like Antaeus, you cannot separate knowledge from contact with the ground. Actually, you cannot separate _Anything_ from contact with the ground. And the contact with the real world is done via skin in the game—having an exposure to the real world, and paying a price for its consequences, good or bad. The abrasions of your skin guide your learning and discovery, a mechanism of organic signaling, what the Greeks called _pathemata mathemata_ ("guide your learning through pain")

> [M]ost things that we believe were "invented" by universities were actually discovered by tinkering and later legitimized by some type of formalization.

Skin in the game allows intrinsic selection effects to weed out incompetence, e.g. NNT cites incompetent pilots crashing as quality assurance. (Weird example, since this never happens: plane accidents are far less frequent than bad pilots, e.g., so there is some other process at play.)

> we end up populating what we call the intelligentsia with people who are delusional, literally mentally deranged, simply because they never have to pay for the consequences of their actions, repeating modernist slogans stripped of all depth.

> [[bureaucracy]] is a construction by which a person is conveniently separated from the consequences of his or her actions.

Insurance makes people more risk-seeking (because it lessens risk), e.g. bank bailouts.

> Decentralization is based on the simple notion that it is easier to macrobullshit than microbullshit.

> The crux of the idea of _The Black Swan_ was _[[essentialism and reification|Platonification]]_, missing central but hidden elements of a thing in the rocess of transforming it into an abstract construct, then causing a blowup.

> The doer wins by doing, not convincing. Entire fields (say economics and other social sciences) become themselves charlatanic because of the absence of skin in the game connecting them back to earth... they will develop elaborate rituals, titles, protocols, and formalities to hide this deficit.

Lindy effect: "What has survived has revealed its robustness to Black Swan events"

Taleb sees [[autonomization]] of fields to be one of the drawbacks to specialization:
> architects today build to impress other architects, and we end up with strange—irreversible—structures that do not satisfy the well-being of residents.

Similarly:
> Book reviews are judged according to how [[plausibility|plausible]] and well written they are, never in how they map to the book (unless of course the author makes them accountable for misrepresentations.)

## Minority Rule: The Most Intolerant Wins
> From past episodes, it looks like all it takes is a few (motivated) activists for the banning of some books, or the blacklisting of some people. The great philosopher and logician Bertrand Russell lost his job at the City University of New York owing to a letter by an angry—and stubborn—mother who did not wish to have her daughter in the same room as the fellow with a dissolute lifestyle and unruly ideas.

## Surgeons Should Not Look Like Surgeons
> Literature doesn't look like literature.

> When results come from dealing directly with reality rather than through the agency of commentators, image matters less, even if it correlates to sills. But image matters quite a bit when there is hierarchy and standardized "job evaluation."

> there may be some correlation between looks and skills (someone who looks athletic is likely to be athletic) but, conditional on having had some success _in spite of not looking the part_, it is potent, even crucial information [that they do not look it].

> In any type of activity or business divorced from the direct filter of skin in the game, the great majority of people know the jargon, play the part, and are intimate with the cosmetic details, but are clueless about the subject.

> In some fake fields like economics, ritualistic and dominated by citation rings, I discovered that _everything_ is in the presentation. So the criticism I've received has never been about the content, but rather the looks. There is a certain language one needs to learn through a long investment, and papers are just iterations around that language.

> _Non teneas aurum totum quod splendet ut aurum / nec pulchrum pomum quodlibet esse bonum._ (Roughly, "Beautiful apples do not necessarily taste better")

However, the above saying is contingent on clearing a _certain bar_. Similar to NNT's view of IQ, low-end apples are often obviously low-quality.

> The author Georges Simenon worked as a teenager in journalism as an assitant to the famous French writer Colette; she taught him to resist the idea of putting imperfect subjunctives and references to zephyrs, rhododendrons, and firmaments in his text—the kind of stuff one does when waxing literary.

On the [[intrinsic and extrinsic]] distinction:
> the minute one is judged by others rather than by reality, things become warped... there are metrics used and "evaluation forms" to fill... the mere fact that an evaluation causes you to be judged not by the end results, but by some intermediary metric that invites you to look sophisticated, brings some distortions. 

(However, there _are_ plenty of forms of useful evaluation/feedback—he's so busy sneering he can't distinguish, just paints everything with a broad brush.)

> the presence of skin in the game does away with the cosmetic

## The facts are true, the news is fake
> Barbers offered comprehensive services; they doubled as surgeons, dispute-resolution experts, and news reporters.

> The great Karl Popper often started a discussion with an unerring representation of his opponent's positions, often exhaustive, as if he were marketing them as his own ideas, before proceeding to systematically dismantle them.

## The Merchandising of Virtue

> If a car salesman tries to sell you a Detroit car while driving a Honda, he is signaling that the wares he is touting may have a problem.
