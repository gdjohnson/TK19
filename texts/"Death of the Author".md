[3:26 PM] suspended reason: So here's the thing that troubles or confuses me with DOTA
[3:26 PM] suspended reason:
His point is that any attempt to attribute text directly to the author, or even one of the characters, is inherently artificial. In fact, when we read, some sentences can’t be attributed. And yet we have no problem with that — in fact, if we aren’t paying close attention, we might not even notice it. We keep reading right through it.
[3:26 PM] suspended reason: Emphasis on directly
[3:26 PM] suspended reason: We can attribute every single line to the author, and we can confidently say that every line reflects in some way the author's psychology
[3:27 PM] suspended reason: This relationship isn't a direct, simplistic, straightforward "every opinion in a book is literally exactly what the author thinks!"
[3:27 PM] suspended reason: But the relationship exists and is meaningful nonetheless
[3:27 PM] suspended reason: Barthes takes this very simplistic, naive authorial attribution and turns it into a parable for all intentionalist/biographical readings period
[3:27 PM] suspended reason: But it's a total strawman!
[3:27 PM] suspended reason: That was never what intentionalists thought!
[3:29 PM] suspended reason: There are literally zero real literary critics/theorists who thought/thinks every line in every novel is a direct expression of the author's opinions/self. They just think that there is a meaningful relationship there, that you can discover important valences to a text by thinking about it in relation to the author's life/opinions/biography
[3:30 PM] suspended reason: Basically, I think DOTA is an extreme form of torque epistemology—responding to abuses of some general principle by critiquing the general principle, rather than the abuses; strawmanning the opponent with an absurdity they've never advocated. Which I really, really dislike because my prejudice is always for general compatabilism and steelmanning
[3:32 PM] suspended reason: I agree 100% that a lot of the appeal of the Twitter shitposting style you reference is about indeterminacy—of attribution/sincerity/etc. And also, with Barthes, that 20th C literature really cranks up that indeterminacy—tho the kind of attributive indeterminacy he points out in e.g. the Balzac has obviously always existed
[3:33 PM] suspended reason: I just don't think it's anything close to the refutation of biographical readings or of intentionalist criticism that it claims to be—it doesn't make a case for death of the author so much as it makes a case for the obfuscation of the author, in literature generally and in modern literature especially, and those are very different arguments
[3:40 PM] suspended reason: (It's possible that I'm projecting a bit onto his project, and read DOTA the way I do because I'm pretty intelelctually situated in the "meaning wars" of literary theory, with its successive schools and smackdowns—new criticism, intentionalism, reader-response—in which each successive camp claims (1) its predecessor was not just an overly limited/reductive/simplistic frame, but an invalid frame, and (2) that the new mode of interpretation it proposes is the true and total means of getting at textual meaning. But Barthes does mention new criticism, which viewed authors as writing behind a "mask" or persona, and the biographical/intentionalist crit that was dominant in the mid-century was far, far more sophisticated than direct attribution of sentences to authors—"Baudelaire's poetry as the failure of Baudelaire the person" is radically different than saying every Baudelaire sentence is what Baudelaire thinks—so it's hard for me to see DOTA as anything other than a strawman)
