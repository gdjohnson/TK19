The giants who come to Agent Cooper in his dreams provide [[[signaling theory|hard-to-fake signals]]] of insider knowledge by making [[predictive processing|predictions]] which are verifiable.

Laura Palmer pressuring Bobby Briggs to deal drugs is an example of Betzig's theory that patriarchy is runaway sexual selection of male behavior selected _by_ women.

The men are revealed as brutish sociopaths; the women collapse into schizophrenia and depression, nervous fits. Still, [[David Lynch|Lynch]] gets the statistical psychology right: a few individuals of character, the suadable middle perched on convenience and expediency, and 3-5% psychopathic.

Agent Cooper begins the series alienated from humans, more interested in the sway of the trees or the taste of cherry pie. By the end of the show, he's willing to sacrifice his life for the townspeople. But even in his domineering, arrogant phase, he's half-right and wholly honorable: he takes responsibility for failure, the noblesse oblige, and everyone knows [[localism]] is as much a hindrance as a help in affairs of social psychologyâ€”a realm where self-deception reigns for the sake of smooth relations.
