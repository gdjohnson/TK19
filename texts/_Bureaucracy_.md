## Inefficiences of management
> In 1986 the GAO found that the average program manager spent twenty-seven months on the job, and many spent less than two years. By contrast, it takes between eleven and twenty years to procure a major new weapons system, from concept to deployment. This means that during the acquisition of a new aircraft or missile, the identify of the program will change five or ten times.
    
> HBS professor J Ronald Fox, who has devoted much of his life to studying and participating in weapons procurement, found that a program manager must spend 30 to 50 percent of his time defending his program inside DOD and to Congress.

> In one case the army was required to spend $5400 to obtain fully competitive bids for spare parts that cost $11,000. In exchange for the $5,400 and the 160 days it took to get the bids, the army saved $100. In short, there is an optimal level of "waste" in any organization, public or private: It is that level below which further savings are worth less than the cost of producing them. With one qualification: You may wish to spend more eliminating fraud than you save in order to deter would-be perpetrators of fraud. This is akin to an insurance company spending $50,000 to investigate a fraudulent claim for $25,000â€”it sends a message to other policyholders not to submit fraudulent claims.

> [Michael Blumenthal:] "You learn very quickly that you do not go down in history as a good or bad Secretary in terms of how well you ran the place..." [A] federal executive spends much of his or her time fending off challenges from rival agencies, coping with criticism from the media and interest groups, and trying to win or retain presidential and congressional support... The head of a public agency is judged and rewarded on the basis of the _appearance_ of success, when success can mean reputation, influence, charm, the absence of criticism, personal ideology, or victory in policy debates... Executives rarely put... energies into administrative matters because they tend to be judged not by whether their agency is well-run but by whether the policies with which they are identified seem to succeed or fail...

> many agencies have goals so vague, controversial, or difficult to achieve that progress toward their realization is hard to assess. Moreover, the rewards for public executives are not wholly, or even primarily, tangible; just as important are the intangible ones, egoistic or ideological considerations such as popularity, a reputation for power or identification with a cause. Michael Blumenthal put it bluntly: In Washington, "you can be successful if you appear to be successful... appearance is as important as reality."

> In politics, the maintenance of the _executive_ is different from the maintenance of the _organization_. Under these circumstances what is surprising is that top government executives spend any time at all on managing their departments

^e62c5c
> One of the central themes of this book is that the management of government agencies is powerfully constrained by limitation on the ability of managers to buy and sell products or hire and fire people on the basis of what best serves the efficiency or productivity of the organization.

## Organizational scope & autonomy

Halperin's Law: Organizations will often prioritize autonomy over funding, because the [[empowerment]] derived from the former outstrips the latter.

> For many years, Hoover also resisted enlarging the FBI's activities to include the systematic investigation of organized crime. He justified this with the simple expedient of denying that there was any such thing as organized crime, whether it be called the Mafia, the syndicate, the outfit, or the mob.

## On studying institutions and organizations

> I have come to have grave doubts that anything worth calling "organization theory" will ever exist... Interesting explanations will exist, some even supported with facts, but these will be partial, place- and time-bound insights.
