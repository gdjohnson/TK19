"Author: [[Suspended Reason]]

Sometimes people get upset when I say "All communication is manipulation." They say, Spendo, sometimes I just share accurate information to the recipient. I'm not trying to manipulate them to follow a specific course of action, I'm just trying to inform them of relevant details!

And that's right. A manipulation is always value neutral on _some_ axes—e.g. regarding the manner in which a task is executed, or the kind of task selected for execution.

Indeed, the party passing along information, in a given interaction, may have no agenda in terms of what the individual does with the information.

But it's still manipulative in the strict sense of attempting bring about better outcomes for the speaker. And the best way to illustrate this is through counterfactual, to say, "What are the things that would or would not occur if the speaker did not speak now, as they have?" That is, what would the differences in the world be, as relevant to the speaker's goals, if they did not speak, and did not speak as they have?

And all these difference, you will find, are mediated by eventual actions, however delayed, on the part of the recipient. For this is the only way that speech can be "a difference that makes a difference"—through a mediating receiver who acts differently as a consequence of receiving the speech.

So, perhaps, if I am asked by a colleague to provide information on a topic, and do not answer, there may be consequences I do not desire. And if I provide inaccurate information, there may be consequences I do not desire. This can be more adversarial, selfish, and cloistered: I may speak only to avoid reprimand from my project manager. Or they may be more expansive, cooperative: I may want to provide accurate information because that will lead to the best results for the organization, in which I hold equity. They may be highly pro-social: I may not want to strain the relationship between myself and the querying colleague.

When we think of "manipulation" we can err by seeing it as a narrow attempt to determine _the specific procedure of action_ the manipulated party follows. But we may merely provide the information so that _any_ procedure of action is followed, and this too is an alteration of the receiver's actions through the provision of speech.
