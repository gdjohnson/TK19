# Historical demons

McElreath follows Gigerenzer in opposing two historical visions of rationality: bounded rationality (satisficing, uses fast & frugal heuristics) and unbounded rationality ("demonic," optimization under constraints). Most historical inquiries "centered on demonic solution."

The Romans contrasted Fortuna, who was fickle and dangerous, with Minvera, deterministic, ordering goddess of wisdom, who brought understanding to man.

> This is part of the historical obstacle to studying heuristics, is that we have a tradition in the West of not looking for them. Of expecting optimization or deterministic solutions that are reliable in all contexts, that we can somehow extract knowledge from its context and have it be useful. It's taken us a long time to develop intellectual traditions... that have gotten out of that problem.

# Empirical problems
Traditional statistical tools and experimental design are not up to studying heuristics.

# Conceptual issues
 
# ?
- Heuristics: ignore some information, _in order to do better_ (outcompetes strategies that use more info)
- Social heuristics: heuristics whose success depends upon behavior of other agents ("[[strategy game]]" or "[[ecological huddle]]")
 
 Social heuristics can be subtle insofar as simple behaviors, ignoring much of the available information, can at a population level become computationally powerful & ~optimizing, leveraging division of labor, comparative advantage, etc. Herbert Simon:
 > Human beings, viewed as behaving systems, are quite sismple. The apparent complexity of our behavior over time is largely a reflection of the complexity of the environment in which we find ourselves
 
 Heuristics may generate feedback, e.g. recognition heuristicâ€”that people e.g. will invest in things they recognize --> leads others to recognize these things more. 

All social heuristics are [[frequency dependent selection|frequency-dependent]]; the payoff depends upon the mix of heuristics in a population.
