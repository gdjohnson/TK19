> There are big schools of reading methods and mathematics methods, and so forth, but if you notice, you'll see the reading scores keep going down—or hardly going up—in spite of the fact that we continually use the same people to improve the methods. _There's_ a witch doctor remedy that doesn't work... Another example is how to treat criminals. We obviously have made no progress—lots of theory, but no progress—in decreasing the amount of crime by the method we use to handle criminals.

In [[cargocult]] science, "the form is perfect. It looks exactly the way it looked before. But it doesn't work. No airplanes land... [Cargo Cult Scientists] follow all the apparent precepts and forms of scientific investigation, but they're missing something essential, because the planes don't land."

Feynman attributes as the causes of cargocult science:
1. A lack of scientific integrity, an "utter honesty" that requires "leaning over backwards," trying constantly to invalidate your theories, working hard to think how you might be wrong.
2. Short-term field incentives—"temporary fame and excitement"
3. "the difficulty of the subject and the inapplicability of the scientific method to the subject" (see the [[inexact sciences]])
4. People [[deception#Self-deception|fooling themselves]]

> The first principle is that you must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool. So you have to be very careful about that. After you've not fooled yourself, it's easy not to fool other scientists. You just have to be honest in a conventional way after that.

Feynman attributes as the consequences of cargocult science:
1. Eventually gaining a bad reputation that outlasts the "temporary fame."
2. 

Feynman is cynical about motives in this way—he is making a reputational case for the negative consequences of cargocult science, trying to appeal to scientists' self-interest. But moreover, it's an argument that's specific to a specific culture and time, a specific set of incentives and abilities to track and monitor scientific reputation. It is not an argument that necessarily ports across scientific cultures, even if it's true of his. See e.g. [[Alexey Guzey]]'s takedown of Walker's sleep science.

One failure mode is that individuals are too reverent to the past:
> Millikan measured the charge on an electron by an experiment with falling oil drops and got an answer which we now know not to be quite right.  It’s a little bit off, because he had the incorrect value for the viscosity of air.  It’s interesting to look at the history of measurements of the charge of the electron, after Millikan.  If you plot them as a function of time, you find that one is a little bigger than Millikan’s, and the next one’s a little bit bigger than that, and the next one’s a little bit bigger than that, until finally they settle down to a number which is higher. Why didn’t they discover that the new number was higher right away?  It’s a thing that scientists are ashamed of—this history—because it’s apparent that people did things like this: When they got a number that was too high above Millikan’s, they thought something must be wrong—and they would look for and find a reason why something might be wrong.  When they got a number closer to Millikan’s value they didn’t look so hard.  And so they eliminated the numbers that were too far off, and did other things like that.
