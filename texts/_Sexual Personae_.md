## Cancelled Preface

> _Persona_ is the Latin word for the clay or wooden mask worn by actors in Greek and Roman theater. Its root is probably _personare_, "to sound through or resound": the mask was a kind of megaphone, projecting the voice to the farthest tiers of spectators. Over time, _persona_ broaded in meaning to include the actor's role and then a social role or public function. Finally, it defined an individual under Roman law, as a citizen with rights and duties. We retain this sense in reverse in our "nonperson" a political victim. By late Latin, _persona_ became a person as we now understand it, a human being apart from his social status. Vico economically fuses the early theatrical and later legal meanings of _persona_ when he says of the Roman _paterfamilias_, "Under the person or mask of the father of the family were concealed all his children and servants."

> Western personality thus originates in the idea of mask. Society is the place of masks, a ritual theater. Persona's artistic origins were recovered by modernism and the [[New Criticisim]], which stripped the text of biographical baggage. For the New Critics, a writer never speaks for himself but only through an assumed persona, a mask. Following World War Two, the classroom set piece was Jonathan Swift's _A Modest Proposal_, where a self-absorbed voice, airily proposing the cannibalistic farming of Irish infants, is the butt of the author's satire. [[knowingness|Irony]] and game-playing are central to this view of literature and life. The New Critical persona was indebted to Jung, who sees a split between our inner and ouer selves, an authentic psychic reality versus the mask conforming to social expectation. Popularized Jungianism, especially in its American feminist form, has become increasingly Rousseauist; that is, it tends to view society as automatically restrictve or oppresive instead of educative or civilizing.

> [_Sexual Personae_'s] title was inspired by a film, [[Ingmar Begman]]'s _Persona_. When I saw it at its American release (in January 1968), it seemed to crystallize the reflections of my college years, which led to the thesis of _Sexual Personae_: that the high development of personality in the West has produced a perverse sexual problematics unique in world culture.

> [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s _Persona_, surely inspired by Strindberg's one-act play _The Stronger_, is about power relationships and the use of personae in scenes of psychic combat. Nature's law here is cruelty, not pit.

> Metaphor operates by simple analogy: this is that... My fetching—or schlepping, as I like to call it—is meant to demonstrate likeness, unity, and coherence where there was division, disorder, or irrelevance.

> After endless quarrels with authority, prankish disruptiveness, and impatience with management and procedure, I now see the hierarchical as both beautiful and necessary. Efficiency liberates; egalitarianism tangles, delays, blocks, deadens. I marvel, in fact, at the extraordinary orderliness of human life, which must be the instinctual brain-based recall of the individual to the group. Even the gods, the preeminent sexual personae of this book, are projections fo our innate biological hierarchism.

> In history, the human drive is toward monarchy. Western culture has produced the best system yet for organizing and taming these king-seeking energies: representative democracy, part of our pagan heritage. But our atavistic longings for hierarchy are satisfied by another pagan institution, Hollywood, with its charismatic, imperial stars

> Science has barely begun to chart the complexities of our multiple hormone systems, which intricately interact and alter us physically and psychologically hour by hour. Hormones are our link to pagan nature.

> The trauma of the Sixties persuaded me that my generation's egalitarianism was a sentimental error. I now see the hierarchical as both beautiful and necessary. Efficiency liberates; egalitarianism tangles, delays, blocks, deadens.
