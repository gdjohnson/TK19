Over the course of the show, decisions about homicides, prosecution, taking or dropping cases, pursuing leads, are made with constant deference to ‘clearance rate’ and the stats, which impacts detectives’ performance reviews and career advancement. All decisions are made over projected gains or hits to reputation. In conversations, power is leveraged through covert threats to reputation (who will get blame or lose credit).

## Season 1

# S1E11:

Burrell orders a coordinated raid that the principal team thinks is counterproductive. The orders from up top are to get "dope on the table," what McNulty refers to as a "photo op."

## Season 2

In S2, despite the state being desperately undermanned and unable to properly handle a tredecuple homicide, the city police try everything they can not to get involved. The same exact dynamic re-emerges at the end of S4, as Lester Freadmon is ordered not to open up the sealed rowhomes.

### S2E1: Ebb Tide

From the Wiki:

> Jimmy McNulty is sidelined to harbor patrol. He discovers a corpse in the harbor and pays back Colonel Rawls by proving City Homicide bear responsibility for the investigation

> Major Valchek feels slighted when the boss of a local stevedore union named Frank Sobotka donates a more impressive gift to a local Polish church... Valchek strikes a deal with Acting Commissioner Burrell—in return for supporting Burrell in his aspirations for promotion, Valchek demands Burrell set up a detail to investigate Sobotka and his union.

### S2E2: Collateral Damage

Rawls: Robbie, I have fought and scratched and clawed for four months to get my clearance rate up above 50% and right now, it stands at exactly 51.6%. Do you happen to know what my clearance rate will be if I take 13 whodunits off your hands? 39.4%.

Valchek: You know, it personally offends me that anybody would reach down past you to elevate some colonel just because he happens to be white. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna get on the phone and call my friends at the Hall. That'll bring the First District in line.

Burrell: That's very kind. And what if anything is there that I can do for you, Maj.
Valchek? 

Valchek: Funny you should ask.

Here's the thing: everyone below Burrell knows what a full-of-shit image-optimizer without ethics he is. But the bureaucracy does not know this. The people above him aren't privy, nor are the politicians, the public. From afar, his image succeeds, even if up close it's all too transparent. (Nevermind that at a certain point, a corrupt power structure will, to preserve itself, send anyone with integrity—McNulty, Daniels—down to the basement to serve as evidence custodians, because people with integrity are a direct threat: they cannot be controlled by blackmail, and they will not look the other way even when it's in their best interest.)

### S2E12: Port in a Storm

> SANNY: What's the verdict? > GREGGS: He did good for us. > SANNY: So I'm out the stat? > GREGGS: I owe you one, Sanny.

### S3E3: Dead Soldiers

> COLVIN: Do it clean. We give them the fucking truth. Don't massage anything, don't sex anything down.
> 
> OFFICER: What about COMSTAT boss? They'll rip you.
> 
> COLVIN: There's five months to my 30, right?

The Major’s morality (”Do it clean”) is not just unexpected, a deviation from norm, but is specifically enabled from his lack of skin in the game (he retires in five months, after serving thirty years, giving him a certain immunity).

Later, upon the presentation of the real crime stats (which the mayor’s office is desperately trying to keep down for re-election):

> RAWLS: The major no doubt has some explanation, some excuse, if you will, for a weekly felony tabulation that's going in the opposite direction from the other eight districts. 
> 
> COLVIN: I have none, sir. 
> 
> RAWLS: You are content with this?
> 
> COLVIN: No, Deputy, I'm unhappy. I wish we were making more of an impact. But doing what we're doing... it's clear that's not the case. 
> 
> RAWLS: Major Colvin, I am under the impression crime is down in the Western. Perhaps you misfigured your felony stats this week. 
> 
> COLVIN: No, sir. We were very accurate. Sometimes the gods are uncooperative. Uncooperative? This is a cooperative effort, a cooperative department. 
> 
> [...] 
> 
> RAWLS: You're having a laugh, aren't you, Bunny? You got the real stats and projections somewhere else. Someone's just outside with them, right? A stripper, maybe? That would be nice. She comes in, flashes a little tit, gives us a whiff of muff and delivers my fucking stat sheets with a reduction that matches what we promised the Mayor. That would be beautiful. That would be crème fucking brûlée. But what I got instead is some half-assed "I wish we were doing better" platitude that's meant to fool maybe a six-year-old girl into thinking you're doing your job. Well, she's left the room, Major Colvin. She's out there right now asking the stripper if she can have her job when she grows up because she sure as shit doesn't want yours! You know why? Because there isn't gonna be a Western District in 20 years if this shit keeps up. I don't care how many years you have on this job. If the felony rate doesn't fall, you most certainly will. The gods are fucking you, you find a way to fuck them back. It's Baltimore, gentlemen. The gods will not save you.

We have everything here: one player can afford to play honesty because he is not up for re-election or promotion, but is in fact exiting the game, and thus has no stakes in its future. Other players in the game are deeply invested and attempting to manipulate this future, and make demands about crime statistics in order to present a good image (optics) to whomever they answer to. (In an officer’s case, his superior; in the commissioner’s case, the mayor; in the mayor’s case, the voting public.)

## S4E9: Juking the Stats

> PREZ: I don't get it. All this so we score higher on the state tests? If we're teaching the kids the test questions, what is it assessing in them? 
> 
> TEACHER: Nothing. It assesses us. The test scores go up, they can say the schools are improving. The scores stay down, they can't. 
>  PREZ: Juking the stats.
> 
> TEACHER: Excuse me? 
> 
> PREZ: Making robberies into larcenies, making rapes disappear. You juke the stats and majors become colonels. I've been here before. 
> 
> TEACHER: Wherever you go, there you are.

# S4E10: Misgivings

The school cranks up the building heat to 80F to keep students drowsy—otherwise they won't sit still during the lengthened 90-minute classes teaching to the test.

# S4E11: A New Day

> CIVIL SERVANT: Mr. Mayor, all hydrants are fully capped as of today, and solid waste has pulled 32 tons of trash from the alleys, and, sir, that's a single-day record. 
> 
> CARCETTI: That's what I want to hear.

Carcetti falls into the stats trap immediately, so busy and overwhelmed by the demands of the job he doesn't even notice. And how else could he judge, from a council room in downtown Baltimore, whether all the hydrants are capped; could he have really noticed a difference in waste on the streets? Does he drive by lower-class alleys so often? There is an information asymmetry, and Carcetti is dependent on self-presentation.

# S4E12:

Both Daniels and Carcetti have ambivalent slides into the optics game. Daniel's is followed by dropped eyes, a realization coming across his face. Carcetti's comes delivered lightheartedly, where it's not clear whether he's winking approval or tossing the spanked Rawls a bone.

> DANIELS: My feeling is that City Hall should be brought into the loop. We pull the bodies now before New Year's, and the stats go to Royce's last year in office. Matter of fact, it gives Carcetti an advantage with regards to next year's crime rate. Tell the mayor that now is the time to empty those houses, not next year, when it's on his watch and he has to eat the stats.
>
> RAWLS: Colonel, I see you've thought this through, [beat] politically, I mean. 
>
> DANIELS: I'm learning as I go.
>
> RAWLS: I bet you fuckin' are

&&

> CARCETTI: Bodies? How many?
>
> RAWLS: Could be quite a few. We won't know until we take down those doors.
>
> CARCETTI: And this is one drug organization you think did this?
>
> RAWLS: That's the theory, but nothing's certain at this point. What is certain is that if we're going to do this, you probably want us to do it now, before the New Year, while the bump in the murder rate is still attributable to Mayor Royce.
>
> CARCETTI: Thoughtful, Deputy, very thoughtful. I don't want any more stat games from your department. You need to get your people into those houses because if there are bodies in there, they need to come out. But do it now. I don't want to be finding any more bodies come January.
>
> RAWLS: Yes, sir, Mr. Mayor, sir.

Their tastes of corruption are mirrored by Namond, who has desperately wanted to have it both ways—to be on the corners, as his mother wants from him, and to keep some part of him alive that cannot be kept alive—to puncture some kind of sacredness around the human life, break apart some kind of conscience. He cannot bring himself to violence; it comes to a climax when he is impelled to enforce against his lieutenant, a kid no older than 12 whose basement has housed the stash until an alleged break-in the week previous. Suspecting the kid's sold the drugs for cash, and invented a story, he shakes him down, but cannot bring himself to beat the boy; Michael is forced to step in, pounding him unconscious. Namond runs off, unable to even take the stolen goods off the body. When he comes in the boxing gym the next day, it's clear what he'd run off to do—to finally kill that part of himself.

# Testimonies to realism of portrayal

> BILL MOYERS: There is a fellow in city government, here in New York, who's a policy wonk and a die-hard WIRE fan. And he's hoping I will ask you the one question on his mind, and the mind of many other fans. Here it is. "David Simon has painted the most vivid and compelling portrait of the modern American city. Has he walked away from that story? And if he has, will he come back to it?"

# [[surrogation]]

> DAVID SIMON: You show me anything that depicts institutional progress in America, school test scores, crime stats, arrest reports, arrest stats, anything that a politician can run on, anything that somebody can get a promotion on. And as soon as you invent that statistical category, 50 people in that institution will be at work trying to figure out a way to make it look as if progress is actually occurring when actually no progress is. 

[...]

> DAVID SIMON: Dope on the table. Stats, you know, "We've made so many arrests." I mean, they used to ride around Baltimore under one administration, and say, "If we can make 54 arrests a day, we'll break the-- we'll have an all-time record for drug arrests."
> 
> Some of the arrests, well, it was people sitting on their stoops and, you know, loitering in a drug free zone, meaning you were sitting on your own steps on a summer day. Anything that is a stat can be cheated, right down to journalism. And I was sort of party to that.
> 
> So, I would be-- I would be watching what the police department was doing, what the school system was, you know, you would look outward. But if you looked inward you'd see that the same game is played everywhere. That nobody's actually in the business of doing what the institution's supposed to do.
