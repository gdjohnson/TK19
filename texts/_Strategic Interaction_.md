# [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] 1969: Strategic Interaction

[[Erving Goffman|Goffman]]'s _Strategic Interaction_ was written "in full awareness of, and to some extent inspired by, Schelling's _The Strategy of Conflict_"—while exhibiting the "dominant tendency among microsociologists to keep [[game theory]] at a distance" (Vollmer 2013). [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] calls "strategic interaction" interaction in which, as with Schelling's definition, players' best moves are determined by fellow players' choice of moves. (_See entries on level-K thinking in [[Theory of Mind]] and [[Reflexivity]] entries._)

> Two or more parties must find themselves in a well-structured situation of mutual impingement where each party must make a move and where every possible move carries fateful implications for all of the parties. In this situation, each player must influence his own decision by his knowing that the other players are likely to try to dope out his decision in advance, and may even appreciate that he knows this is likely. Courses of action or moves will then be made in light of one's thoughts about the others' thoughts about oneself. An exchange of moves made on the basis of this kind of orientation to self and others can be called strategic interaction.

> If a subject does not know about the kinds of cues in his own situation a sophisticated observer can use as a source of information, then the subject can hardly obfuscate them (or accentuate them), were he desirous of doing so.

> As G.H. Mead has argued, when an individual considers taking a course of action, he is likely to hold off until he has imagined in his mind the consequence of his action for others involved, their likely response to this consequence, and the bearing of this response on his own designs. He then modifies his action so that it now incorporates that which he calculates will usefully modify the other's generated response. In effect, he adapts to the other's response before it has been called forth, and adapts in such a way that it never does have to be made.

[[Erving Goffman|Goffman]]'s aim is "to isolate the analytical framework implied in the game perspective" by demonstrating the insufficiency of a [[game theory|game-theoretic]] framework in handling "real-life situations." Like other sociologists, he seens [[game theory]] as "unduly generalizing from the analysis of a narrow subset of social situations and as failing to understand situations within this narrow set to begin with" (Vollmer 2013). Somewhat bizarrely, [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] dismisses [[game theory]] as focusing on zero-sum games (despite Schelling's framework explicitly focusing on mixed motives games):

> The idea of all-out, 'zero-sum,' opposition, and of a pure and tight game, does not cover all that is to be considered. And while thenotion of a game of coordination expands matters a little, too much is still left out.

In everyday interaction, players exist in an "ecological huddle" where they can monitor, observe, learn from, mirror, and dynamically adapt to one anothers' moves.

## "Expression Games"

[[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] calls "strategic interaction" the "calculative, gamelike aspects of mutual dealings." "In this paper," he writes, "I want to explore one general human capacity [...] to acquire, reveal, and conceal information."

We're in the field of optics, [[opticratics]]. Negotiating the gap between being and appearing. [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] looks to intelligence communities, espionage theory, interrogation tactics for his answers, though we can imagine similar studies drawing on poker, warfare, business, and bargaining (that's the side of the road Schelling walked in Strategy of Conflict; the approaches are closely linked).

[[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] starts with a couple premises/carvings, and builds on them:

* Individuals "exude expressions."
* These expressions contain information.
* This information is "discursive" in the sense that it "pertains to the general relationship of that individual to what is transpiring" around him, i.e., to use Garfinkel's term, it's indexical: meaning is "bound to context."
* All interactions with individuals carry some information, but "face-to-face interaction has a special place because whenever an individual can be observed directly, a multitude of good sources of expressed information become available."

### Communication vs Expression

Much like ethology distinguishes between [[signaling theory|signals and cues]]—one strategic & intentional, the other unintentional—[[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] distinguishes between _communicated information_ and _expressed information_. If a signal is a songbird proclaiming his presence, a cue is the rustle of branches as he takes flight. To the observer, both events are sources of information, but to the emitter, only the former was desired to be communicated. (The emitter would rather hide his cues, and not rustle the branches, but the branch-rustling is a side-effect of movement. At best, emitted cues tend to be harmless; at worst, they're fatal. There's a conflation here of "benefit" with "intent," since the two naturally couple in systems of natural selection, but they aren't necessarily bound together in human domains—teasing that apart is a project for another post.) Anyway, so it is with [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]]. In expressed information, like a cue, "the generating of expression and hence making its information available is not an official end of the action but (at least ostensibly) only a side effect." Whereas communicated information involves "the intentional transmission of information."

[[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] sees personal style as a major source, for observers, of both intentional signals and unwitting cues:

> Discursive statements seem inevitably to manifest a style of some kind, and can never apparently be entirely free of "egocentric particulars" and other context-tied meanings. Even a written text examined in terms of the semantic meaning of the sentences can be examined for expression that derives from the way a given meaning is styled and patterned, as when _Izvestia_ and _Pravda_ are read by our intelligent people "symptomatically," for what the Russians do not know they are exuding through the print.

While all expression contains some trace of style, it is face-to-face expression in particular that is most rich in information.

### Types of moves

In these expression games, where an observer attempts to extract reliable information from a subject, and the subject attempts to manipulate or mask that information, there are several types of moves.

First, an _unwitting move_: "the subject's observable behavior is unoriented to the assessment an observer might be making." Second, a _control move_: "the intentional effort of an informant to produce expressions that he thinks will improve his situation," of which one kind is a "covering move."

On the observer's end, he may or may not perceive the subject's move as "naive," that is, as unwitting. If he perceives it as not being naive, that is, as being a control move, he may make an _uncovering_ move.

Control moves are made through theory of mind calculations: "the subject turns on himself and from the point of view of the observer perceives his own activity in order to exert control over it" (_cf_ Rochat's _Others in Mind_). This [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] calls *impression management*.

[[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] goes on to differentiate between other deceptive moves and strategies, drawing on espionage theory. _Overt_ secret ops admit their general agenda, but conceal the details. _Covert_ ops carry on under a false cover agenda. _Clandestine_ ops are totally hidden from view; their mere fact is concealed. Furthermore, there is a distinction between a _feint_, when one fakes a course of action, and a _feign_, when one fakes a belief, attitude, or preference.

> Of the 50 American buyers at the Pitti Palace show of spring fashions, several admitted off the record that they never clap for the haute couture creations they like best. They don't want their competitors to know what they will order. At the same time, these buyers confessed, they applauded enthusiastically for sportswear, boutique items, and gowns that they wouldn't consider featuring in their own stores.

### Communication as predictive manipulation

[[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] has a [[proto-predictive processing]] view of behavior, intelligence, and optimization, in accord with the view of [[intelligence as futures optimization|mutual modeling of futures]]:

> All organisms after their fashion make use of information collected from their immediate environment so as to respond effectively to what is going on around them and to what is likely to occur.

And as it is in observers' interests to seek out information and act on its basis, it is in observed agents' interest to manipulate the information observers pick up, so as to bring about their own best interests:
> Just as it can be assumed that it is in the interests of the observer to acquire information from a subject, so it is in the interests of the subject to appreciate that this is occurring and to control and manage the information the observer obtains; for in this way the subject can influence in his own favor responses to a situation which includes himself."

(In a phrase, "[[All communication is manipulation]].")

This capacity is the capacity to "inhibit and fabricate expression"; it is exacerbated in "situations where an observer is dependent on what he can learn from a subject, there being no sufficient alternate sources of info." When evaluation bottlenecks on self-report, the observer is in trouble. "A contest over assessment occurs"; the interrogator/observer wishes to get the "truth," at least relevant to his ends, while the interrogated subject wishes for his own optimal outcome. (Which IMO can be meaningfully conceptualized as selection or non-selection.) [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]], following [[ethnomethodology]], calls subjects' self-representing communications "accounts" or "explanations"—tellings meant to alter the assessment an observer would otherwise make. Accounts can be produced spontaneously or in response to questioning, and either voluntarily or under pressure.

### Identity tags

One system we have for preventing false accounts by malicious actors [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] calls "identity tags." I've talked before about names, [[reputation|reputational]] ledgers, social security numbers, and credit scores as systems of tracking historical defection/cooperation behavior. Similarly, [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] writes, these tags are "officially recognized seals which bond an individual to his biography"; they are "an admission that an expression game is being played, and that through identification devices the person who would misrepresent himself will be defeated." 

In espionage, "pocket litter"—objects like pens, notes, billfolds, etc—are one means of verifying identities of foreign spies. But more subtle tests like questioning about biographical info and local lore, a subject's sense of fashion and orientation to local context, etc can constitute identity tags/tests.

> Natives never appreciate how well-trained they are in the arts of detection until they find an alien among themselves who is trying to pass. Then, ways of doing things that had always been taking for granted stand out by virtue of the presence of someone who is inadvertently doing the same things differently, as when milk is put in a cup before the tea, or the numeral four is written with a crossbar, or pie eaten from the apex, not the side.

Tarantino fans, of course, will recognize an _Inglorious Basterds_ scene in this description: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_lq2p7-p2Y. Subtle differences in gesture are the [[metonyms]] which give away the whole interpretation ("not from around here").

What are natives doing, in such a situation? They are separating the real from the fake, the realities from the appearances, the actuals from the imposters. (They will inevitably lean on [[surrogation|surrogates]].)

## Strategic Interaction

> Wherever students of the human scene have considered the dealings individuals have considered the dealings individuals have with one another, the issue of calculation has arisen: When a respectable motive is given for action, are we to suspect an ulterior one? When an individual supports a promise or threat with a convincing display of emotional expression, are we to believe him? When an individual seems carried away by feeling, is he intentionally acting this way in order to create an effect?

This strategic self-interest, [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] writes, is "one sense in which an actor is said to be rational." The strategic situation does not take many assumptions to emerge—"Once nature, self-interest, and an intelligent opponent are assumed, nothing else need be; strategic interaction follows."

### Strategic entities and qualities

[[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] carves up four entities in strategic interaction:
1. PARTY: "something with a unitary interest to promote"
2. COALITION: 2+ parties united in provisional common interest
3. PLAYER: works on behalf of a party or coalition, which is often himself
4. PAWN: a player whose own welfare is placed in jeopardy by the interests of playing parties

Players have:
1. Operational codes (their orientation to gaming)
2. Normative constraints (self-imposed moral conditions for achieving goals)
3. Styles of play
4. Informational states (what they know relevant to situation at-hand)
5. Resources and capacities (what they can do relevant to situation at-hand)

...and some of the skills that make "quality gamesmen" include the ability to:
1. Pass up [[short-termism|short-term]] incentives for long-term payoff
2. Parse information effectively
3. Simulate moves (predictively)
4. Act under pressure and set aside personal feelings

Finally, this player and his interaction have a _position_, the intersection of historic moves and enabled, possible future moves.

### Moves, constraints, and the problem of dishonesty

Players can make _conditional_ and _unconditional_ avowals (e.g. "I will X if you Y," or just "I will X irrespective of your move"). These avowals are assessed based on _[[reputation|credibility]]_, a composite evaluation of the avower's sincerity, resolve, and capacity to follow through. This is different, [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] stresses, from "trust," which he sees as a moral concept covering sincerity and resolve alone. But, just as crucial in a strategic assessment is, separate from whether a party _believes_ or _intended_ to follow through on a promise, whether they successfully can.

"It is in the nature of words," [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] writes, "that it will always be physically possible to employ them unbelievingly. Schelling in _Strategy of Conflict_ concurs: Players negotiating amidst play "have no way to persuade each other that they mean what they say, except by showing it in the way that they play." (And even here, there is the n-1 problem in [[game theory]], where in iterated games cooperating players are incentivized to begin defecting near the final turns.)

How then do we convince others to believe us? It appears that we constantly make decisions based on others' words, and take others' words at least provisionally at face value. How does this work? In [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]]'s phrasing, "since words can be faked, what grounds can self-respecting players have for putting faith in any of them?" 

There are several answers [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] proposes. First, he proposes that many of the situations in which we *appear* to make high-cost decisions on words alone, we in fact do nothing of the sort. For instance, in auctions, we _appear_ to take individual bids at face value, and to make decisions based on them. But, with closer inspection, we come to realize that, in fact, nothing material is bought or sold in this process by words alone. The top bidder has merely won the _right_ to purchase the item at the bid price. Similarly, in brokerage, if a client puts in an order for a stock over the telephone, a broker can "trustingly" put in the order for the stock, using the brokerage firm's funds, because the greatest risk is that the stock is re-sold a few days later, after non-payment, and the aggregate financial risk of such transactions is negligible. The client has not bought the stock verbally so much as they've verbally ordered the option to buy the stock from the brokerage firm. [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]]:

> Verbal communication in the absence of a normative basis for trust ought to be possible whenever the speaker can show the listener that there is relatively little to lose in crediting his words—a reduction of the need for trust by a reduction of what is trusted.

(Sidenote: it's very weird he uses "trust" here instead of "credibility"; it seems to contradict his previous distinction.)

A second, somewhat less obvious case in which individuals can take communications at face value is any situation in which both parties are playing a purely coordinative (to Schelling, fixed-ratio, variable sum) game. All harms and benefits are shared equally among participants. Importantly, the activity must not merely by purely coordinative, but there must be _common knowledge_ that it is purely coordinative, so that each party is not suspicious of the other's intentions or understanding—so that each knows that the other knows that each knows cooperation is in their rational self-interest.

Finally, there are iterated games. You build [[reputation|reputational]] credit in order to keep playing. Deception is against your own self-interest because, if uncovered, you will be excluded from the game. Intriguingly, [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] notes that, in the standard game theoretic picture, rationally self-interested actors would "build up these trust credits until a time is found when the stakes are such as to make it worthwhile to expend all one's credits in a very profitable betrayal of one's world." And yet few, in reality, behave this way—cash in. Why? One answer I've come up with is the mythological concept of legacy after death.

## Intrinsic vs Extrinsic Payoffs

The big distinction [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] brings up here is games with "intrinsic" payoffs and games with "extrinsic" payoffs. 

Intrinsic payoffs are when 
> the course of action taken and the administration of losses and gains in consequence of play are part of the same seamless situation, much as in duels of honor, where the success of the swordsman's lunge and the administration of an injury are part of a single whole.

This is in contrast to socially mediated systems of extrinsic payoff.

> A clear hit in mortal swordplay can perfectly well occur in a foggy night, the clarity of the hit having to do with its psychological consequence for the hit organism. But in games where hits are merely points, a move must often be terminated with an act of perceptual clarity, lest there be a dispute as to what, actually, happened.

Wherever "enforcement is part of implacable nature, cheating is not possible—it is not even thinkable. But where judges have to attend to points, trickery of various kinds will always be possible." 

Thus, we might speculate, as practices and games are increasingly social, and less natural, they become more [[opticratics|opticratic]].

But furthermore, in socially mediated games, words can be binding in a way that they are not with unmediated games. "Once social agencies are introduced as enforcers, it is relatively easy to support spoken statements as moves." This is the realm of performative utterances (see [[Language]]) sub-entry on performativity for full context).
