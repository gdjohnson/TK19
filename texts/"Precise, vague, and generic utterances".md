When I say “All communication is manipulation,” it is sometimes protested that many utterances are advanced without a clear goal in mind.

The first issue here is that one need not hold a desired outcome consciously in mind in order for one’s behavior to be shaped by, attracted to, and in the service of a desired outcome. We are not transparent to others or ourselves.

But I will readily grant that many communicative moves do not have specific outcomes in mind (otherwise we would be constantly disappointed). Rather, utterances can be strategically aimed with varying levels of specificity or narrowness. I will carve these into three classes of goals: precise, vague, generic, and bespoke.

Precisely strategic utterances are uttered with a specific end result in mind—for instance, telling a police officer a lie in order to avoid a traffic ticket. There is a single, binary outcome kept in mind which is either met or not met.

Vaguely strategic utterances attempt to shift an interaction or situation toward a vaguely better situation, or away from a vaguely worse situation—for instance, avoiding certain topics in professional settings to avoid unspecified blowback, conflict, or disharmony. One steers with, and follows, the winds, instead of seeking a singular destination.

Finally, generically strategic utterances are those which are uttered for a large audience, attempting to achieve a number of vague or specific goals among the largest possible swathe of audience—for instance, presenting a consumer product as organic in order to increase its buyer appeal among certain demographics, or presenting a specific political front with the precise goal of winning an election. This is in contrast to what we might consider “bespoke” utterances.

Of course, generic and bespoke, vague and precise, lie on a spectrum. No utterance is crafted fully generically or totally bespoke. No desired outcome is perfectly specific or totally vague. In other words, manipulation is always value-neutral on certain axes. We may specifically wish to avoid a traffic ticket, but be agnostic as to whether the officer, during the traffic stop, makes small talk about the weather, his golden retriever, or the evolved origins of back pain. And even when we believe that our interactive desires are at their most open-ended, that we are perfectly agnostic to whatever response we might receive, we can easily find ourselves surprised, upset, enraged, or disappointed by the emotional tenor or semantic content of the response.
