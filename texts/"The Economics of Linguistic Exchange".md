> Perhaps from force of occupational habit, perhaps by virtue of the calm that is acquired by every important man who IS consulted for his advice and who, knowing that he will keep control over the situation, sits back and lets his inter locutor flap and fluster, perhaps also in order to show off to advantage the character of his head (which he believed to be Grecian, in spite of his whiskers), while something was being explained to him, M. de Norpois maintained an immobility of expression as absolute as if you had been speaking in front of some classical and deaf bust in a museum. 

Proust, _A la recherche du temps perdu_, introduction

On action approach vs. product (or "intellectualist") approach to linguistics:
> A whole sociological analysis is needed of the reasons why the intellectualist philosophy which makes language an object of understanding rather than an instrument of action (or power) has been so readily accepted by anthropologists and sociologists.

His sociological critique replaces "the meaning of speech with the question of the value and power of speech." It also replaces "linguistic competence" with "symbolic capital," and "grammaticalness" with social acceptability or legitimacy. Power structures between participants are made central.

> Practical competence is learnt in situations, in practice: what is learnt is, inextricably, the practical mastery of language and the practical mastery of situations which enable one to produce the adequate speech in a given situation. The expressive intent, the way of actualizing it, and the conditions of its actualization are indissociable. It follows, inter alia, that the different meanings of the same word are not perceived as such: only the learned awareness which breaks the organic relation between competence and the field brings out the plurality of meanings, which are ungraspable in practice because, in practice, production is always embedded in the field of reception.

The different meanings of a lexeme are largely the product of different fields or "markets":
> the different meanings of the word group refer us to specific fields, themselves objectively situated in relation to the field in which the ordinary meaning is defined ("a number of persons or things assembled in one place") : (1) the field of painting and sculpture: "an assemblage of figures forming together a complete design, or a distinct portion of one"; (2) the field of music: a small ensemble, a trio or quartet; (3) the field of literature: a coterie, a school (the Pleiade group); (4) the field of economics: a set of firms linked in various ways (a financial group, an industrial group); (5) the field of biology: a blood group; (6) the field of mathematics: group theory, etc.

Symbolic capital or authority is crucial because individuals are believed on account of the authority they wield (to be listened to, to be believed):
> One does not speak to any Tom, Dick or Harry; any Tom, Dick or Harry does not take the floor. Speech presupposes a legitimate transmitter addressing a legitimate receiver, one who is recognized and recognizing... Linguistics reduces to an intellectual encoding-decoding operation what is in fact a symbolic power relation, that is, an encoding-decoding relation founded on an authority-belief relation. Listening is believing. As is clearly seen in the case of orders and watchwords, the power of words is never anything other than the power to mobilize the authority accumulated within a field (a power which obviously presupposes specifically linguistic competenceâ€”cf. mastery of liturgy).

Linguistic competence is merely a surrogate for evaluating authority, or else an ability which typically coincides with the attainment of authority within a community (of speakers) more broadly.
