# Typification

In perceiving and experiencing, we are always determining (albeit, usually automatically and unconsciously) what "type" of thing a sensorily experienced object is, and then experiencing that object through its relation to a type:

> Schutz follows Husserl in arguing that an experiencing consciousness is inherently a typifying one. The constructs in terms of which an "object" of some kind is constituted of a set of sensory presentations are themselves the "sedimented" products of past activities of comparing and contrasting out of which mundane typifications arise... [All new experiences are interpreted through this typifying] stock of knowledge at hand.

>the actors' type constructs are the (revisable) yardsticks in terms of which their experience of their world is organized and upon which they rely in order to make sense of a world in which they must act.

These are our "type constructs," e.g. "mountain" or "tree," and alongside typified "recipe knowledge" ("how to do it"), "minimall comprise" the stock of our commonsense knowledge.

Type constructs are applied with the "[[natural attitude]]"—the idea that "as [actors] see things, so they are." (See also [[opticratics]].) Evaluation of perception through typicals is not deliberate or "intellectual" but unreflecting:

> actors do not, in the normal run of events, "consult" that knowledge of types in such a way that, finding for example that a newly observed "Irish Wolfhound" conforms with a knowledge of "typical dogs," they proclaim their knowledge of the latter to be confirmed. This would be to "intellectualize" social actors and indeed to suggest that, like a scientist, they are constantly engaged in testing out the adequacy of their constructs. This is not the case. **Rather, actors simply _see_ objects "in their mode of typicality."** Their "employment" of the constructs is largely unreflecting and pragmatic. Indeed, preoccupied with acting on the world in the "here and now" they cannot afford to reflect on the adequacy of their type constructs and **will only do so if the world starts to run counter to expectations. **

(See also ideas about the role of genres and [[values hierarchy]] in artistic evaluation; debates about language in [[Maggie Nelson]]'s _[[The Argonauts]]_; and the concept of schematic subversion and updating in [[predictive processing]] and [[predictive hermeneutics]].)

These type constructs always "abstract from the concrete uniqueness of objects and events and they therefore bear an inherently approximate, adjustable, and '[[genericism|elastic]]' relation to the objects they typify." There is always a great deal of [[ambiguity|gappiness]] to "fill in" as one encounters a particular, and nuances their understanding from the starting point of a type. They may also change their opinion, if enough evidence contradicts their initial assessment, as to what type of thing an object or event in front of them is. 

> The congruence of these constructs is continuously adjusted in face-to-face interaction in the light of whether the other's actions confirm, or fail to confirm, the anticipations of the actor on which his or her own conduct is based.

Furthermore, there are a set of overlapping types which any object can exemplify:

> "Rover" can be viewed as an animal, a vertebrate, a mammal, a dog, an Irish Setter, my friend and companion of the last seven years, and so on. Moreover, the relative precision etc. of these typfiications is necessarily contextual and can be determined _only_ [[pragmatic ontology|in relation to the actor's practical purposes]]. The construct "dog" may be sufficient for the actor's purposes as he or she reviews the shelves of tins in a supermarket with a view of buying Rover's dinner. It will not be sufficient when the actor tries to enter Rover in a dog show. Thus, Schutz argues, the actor can typify "Rover" in many ways, and these typifications will be invoked and [[framing#Strategic conceptualization|in accordance with his or her current practical purposes and relevancies]].

These types are only partially originating from personal experience—more often, they come from other actors and media, which "socialize" actors into them. 

#### Social roles

As an example of socialization into typicals, Schutz uses the example of ticket collectors:

> The child learns that there are men called "ticket collectors" who stand at the end of platforms in railway stations and take passengers' tickets as they file past. The child may also graduall y learn that when a passenger fails to present a ticket, the ticket collector will seek to prevent him from leaving the platform and, more generally, will "take steps" about it. A large proportion of routine social activity, Schutz suggests, is organized through similar typified constructs.

These "patterns of typified constructs" are often "institutionalized as a standard of behaviour... by specific means of so-called social control, such as the legal order." They are also "anonymous" insofar as they do not require, and do not make reference to, the typified actor's "personal intentions, goals, hopes, or fears":

> In the transaction of handing over and receiving a train ticket, both parties anonymize themselves by "living up to" their institutional roles of passenger and ticket collector and no more than that.

We must rely on generic typifications for smooth interaction with individuals in roles whose personal identities we have no real model of. Heritage:

> When I write to my bank manager, I have to hope that my justification of my need for a loan will square with the kinds of considerations which he will treat as adequate grounds for granting it. And my likelihood of success will depend on the _initial_ adequacy of my constructs of his criteria of decision-making: there is no opportunity for me to revise my argument on seeing him frown.

#### Face-to-face interactions

In face-to-face interactions, actors "relate to one another in terms of constructs which are much more familiar, detailed and specific." (See also [[Hotel Concierge]] in [[The Tower]] on nuancing [[typification|stereotype]].) 

> Moreover these constructs are varyingly infused with the sedimented emotional clourings which derive from the actors' biographical experience... [T]he other's actions are interpreted in the light of gestures, mannerisms, bodily comportment and facial expressions—all of which are treated as [[metonyms|indications]] of subjectively meaningful processes.

Schutz writes:

> as I confront my fellow-man [in a face-to-face situation], I bring into each concrete situation a stock of pre-constituted knowledge which includes a network of typifications of human individuals in general, of typical human motivations, goals, and action patterns. It also includes knowledge of expressive and interpretive schemes, of objective sign systems and, in particular, of the vernacular language. I have more specific information about particular kinds and groups of men, of their motivations and actions. If I formerly had direct experience of this particular fellow-man now confronting me, I may, of course, fall back on the highly specialized information sedimented in these experiences. In the on-going experiences of the We-relation I check and revise my previous knowledge about my partner and accumulate new knowledge about him. Thereby my general stock of knowledge also undergoes a continuous modification. My experience of a fellow-man in the We-relation thus stands in a multiple context of meaning: it is experience of a human being, it is experience of a typical actor on the social scene, it is experience of this particular fellow-man, and it is experience of this particular fellow-man in this particular situation, Here and Now.
