> The term "transmitted information" has a technical meaning defined by chances in the predictability of the receiver's behaviour as viewed by a nonparticipant observer. By this definition, a signal transmits information to a receiver when its occurrence increases the predictability of the receiver's subsequent behaviour. 

> mimicry limited by disadvantages of increased discrimination by the receiver, results in the indefinite persistence of deceitful signals. The advantage of increased discrimination tend to increase as mimics increase in frequency and to decrease as mimics decrease. The level of discrimination by receivers reaches a stable compromise depending on the relative frequency of deceivers encountered by a receiver.
