Morris writes that:
- Peirce is fundamentally a Kantian
- Dewey is fundamentally a Hegelian
- James is fundamentally a Mills stan/British empiricist

Each has a slightly different read on what pragmatism is, but each sees it as squaring firmly with their influences, and with some general concept of action-oriented semiotics.

# Pragmatic Semiotic
> What is historically distinctive of the pragmatic orientation—and as unique as anything in philosophy is unique—is the view that there is an intrinsic connection between meaning and action, such that the nature of meaning can be clarified only by reference to action.

Peirce's pragmatism is first and foremost a "behavioral semiotic" in which there is an "intrinsic connection" between action, experience, and meaning. And we cannot forget that "Peirce was trained, and worked, as a physical scientist," whose worldview was shaped by scientific experimentation, and who wrote:
> [For] the typical experimentalist, you will find that whatever assertion you may make to him, he will either understand as meaning that if a given prescription for an experiment ever can be and ever is carried out in act, an experience of a given description will result, or else he will see no sense at all in what you say.

Peirce's pragmatic maxim:
> Consider what effects, that might conceivably have practical bearings, we conceive the object of our conception to have. Then, our concept of these efforts is the whole of our conception of the object.

> In order to ascertain the meaning of an intellectual conception one should consider what practical consequences might conceivably result by necessity from the truth of that conception, and the sum of these consequences will constitute the entire meaning of the conception.

And:
> The most perfect account of a concept that words can convey will consist in a description of the habit which that concept is calculated to produce. But how otherwise can a habit be described than by a description of the kind of action to which it gives rise, with the specification of the conditions and of the motive?

Finally, in a line that essentially compresses Austin's 1965 _How To Do Things With Words_—a book which Goffman refers to as the only work to make conceptual progress on linguistic frameworks, in its implicit bridging of language "game" and "frame"—Peirce writes:
> Pragmatism is the principle that every theoretical judgment expressible in a sentence in the indicative mood is a confused form of thought whose only meaning, if it has any, lies in its tendency to enforce a corresponding practical maxim expressible as a conditional sentence having its apodosis in the imperative mood.

James summarizes Peirce's pragmatic doctrine as follows:
> The pragmatic rule is that the meaning of a concept may always be found, if not in some sensible particular which it directly designates, then in some particular difference in the course of human experience which its being true will make.

> The whole "meaning" of a conception expresses itself in the practical consequences, consequences either in the shape of conduct to be recommended, or in that of experiences to be expected, if the conception is true; which consequences would be different if it were untrue, and must be different from the consequences by which the meaning of other conceptions is in turn expressed.

Mead, who never interacted with Peirce, but was influenced by James and Wilhelm Wundt, writes:
> Meaning arises and lies within the field of the relation between the gesture of a given human organism and the subsequent behavior of this organism as indicated to another human organism by that gesture.

And Dewey in turn elaborates:
> We may frame at least a hypothesis that all judgments of fact have reference to a determination of courses of action to be tried and to the discovery of means for their realization.
